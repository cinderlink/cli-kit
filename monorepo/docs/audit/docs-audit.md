# Documentation Audit

## Overview
This is the master audit document for the tuix project's documentation and code quality. This audit ensures our documentation is organized, terse, informative, and directly linked to our codebase features.

## Audit Process
1. **Framework Setup** - Create audit structure, standards, and checklists
2. **Documentation Review** - Audit all docs for accuracy, completeness, and organization
3. **Code Review** - Verify all features are documented and tested
4. **Relationship Mapping** - Track connections between docs, code, and tests
5. **Standards Compliance** - Ensure adherence to CODE_STANDARDS.md and DOC_STANDARDS.md
6. **Cleanup** - Remove redundant/bad docs, consolidate features
7. **Validation** - Run tests and type checking to verify claims

## Audit Rules
- Every .ts file must have a corresponding .test.ts file
- JSX is preferred where it doesn't introduce complications
- Single implementation principle - no duplicate features
- All public APIs must be documented
- Documentation must link to relevant code examples
- Claims in docs must be verified against actual code
- Redundant features must be identified for removal/consolidation

- [x] Framework created
