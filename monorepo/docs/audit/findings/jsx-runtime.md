# Audit Finding: src/jsx-runtime.ts

## File: src/jsx-runtime.ts

### Purpose
JSX runtime for building terminal UIs with React JSX transform and Svelte-inspired binding support

### Current Status
- **Documented**: Partial - Basic module doc but many features undocumented
- **Tested**: No - Missing `src/jsx-runtime.test.ts`
- **Used By**: All JSX components and applications
- **Dependencies**: core/types, core/view, styling, reactivity/runes

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Type Safety**: Fair - Good JSX namespace types but complex plugin registry with many `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Poor - Limited error handling, lots of unsafe operations
- **Effect Usage**: Minimal - Some Effect integration but not consistent
- **API Design**: Poor - Extremely complex, 1150+ lines mixing multiple concerns

### Documentation Assessment
- **Completeness**: Poor - Many undocumented features and complex internals
- **Accuracy**: Fair - Basic docs accurate but incomplete
- **Examples**: Poor - No usage examples in docs
- **Links**: Poor - Limited cross-references

### Test Assessment
- **Coverage**: 0% - No test file exists
- **Quality**: N/A
- **Types**: N/A
- **Performance**: Unknown - Complex runtime might have perf issues

### Issues Found
- [x] **Issue 1**: CRITICAL - No tests for complex runtime
- [x] **Issue 2**: Plugin registry is doing too much (command building, state mgmt, context tracking)
- [x] **Issue 3**: Mixing declarative plugin/command building with JSX rendering
- [x] **Issue 4**: Many `any` types throughout (plugins, handlers, state)
- [x] **Issue 5**: Side effects in render functions (plugin registration)
- [x] **Issue 6**: Circular dependency issues (lazy requires)

### Recommendations
- [x] **Recommendation 1**: Split into multiple modules (jsx-runtime, plugin-registry, command-builder)
- [x] **Recommendation 2**: Add comprehensive tests immediately
- [x] **Recommendation 3**: Remove side effects from JSX rendering
- [x] **Recommendation 4**: Simplify API - too many features in one file
- [x] **Recommendation 5**: Fix type safety - remove `any` types

### Standards Compliance
- [ ] **CODE_STANDARDS.md**: Non-compliant - Many `any` types, poor separation
- [ ] **DOC_STANDARDS.md**: Non-compliant - Poor documentation
- [ ] **Single Implementation**: Violated - Multiple concerns mixed
- [x] **JSX Preference**: Compliant - This IS the JSX implementation

### Action Items
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Split into focused modules
- [x] **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive test suite
- [x] **High Priority**: Remove plugin/command building from JSX runtime
- [x] **High Priority**: Fix type safety issues
- [x] **Medium Priority**: Improve documentation

### Final Status
**Decision**: Refactor Required
**Reason**: Core JSX runtime is mixed with too many concerns. Needs major refactoring into focused modules with proper tests.
