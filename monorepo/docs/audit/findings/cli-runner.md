# Audit Finding: src/cli/runner.ts

## File: src/cli/runner.ts

### Purpose
Main execution engine for CLI applications that orchestrates parsing, routing, plugin loading, and command execution with TUI runtime integration.

### Current Status
- **Documented**: Good - Most methods have JSDoc with clear purpose
- **Tested**: No - Missing `src/cli/runner.test.ts`
- **Used By**: CLI framework as the main execution engine
- **Dependencies**: Effect, core/runtime, services/impl, cli/types, cli/plugin, cli/parser, cli/router, cli/config

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Type Safety**: Good - Proper TypeScript with type guards
- **Error Handling**: Good - Comprehensive error handling with proper Effect integration
- **Effect Usage**: Excellent - Full Effect integration with runtime
- **API Design**: Good - Clean separation of concerns

### Documentation Assessment
- **Completeness**: Good - Most methods documented with purpose
- **Accuracy**: Good - Documentation matches implementation
- **Examples**: Poor - No usage examples provided
- **Links**: Poor - No references to related modules

### Test Assessment
- **Coverage**: 0% - No test file exists
- **Quality**: N/A
- **Types**: Good - Well-typed with proper type guards
- **Performance**: Good - Efficient execution flow

### Issues Found
- [x] **Issue 1**: Missing test file
- [ ] **Issue 2**: Console logging instead of proper logging (lines 107, 110, 132, 139, 149, 153-159, 167, 174, 196, 204, 220, 240)
- [ ] **Issue 3**: Direct process.exit calls (lines 50, 60, 123) - not testable
- [ ] **Issue 4**: Unused viewToComponent method (lines 266-281)
- [ ] **Issue 5**: Plugin loading uses console.warn instead of proper error handling
- [ ] **Issue 6**: Mixed async/await and Effect patterns

### Recommendations
- [x] **Recommendation 1**: Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] **Recommendation 2**: Replace console logging with proper logging service
- [ ] **Recommendation 3**: Make process.exit calls configurable for testing
- [ ] **Recommendation 4**: Remove unused viewToComponent method
- [ ] **Recommendation 5**: Use Effect throughout for plugin loading
- [ ] **Recommendation 6**: Add usage examples in documentation

### Standards Compliance
- [ ] **CODE_STANDARDS.md**: Partial - Console logging instead of proper logging
- [x] **DOC_STANDARDS.md**: Good - Most methods documented
- [x] **Single Implementation**: Compliant - Single runner system
- [x] **Effect Usage**: Excellent - Full Effect integration with runtime

### Action Items
- [x] **High Priority**: Create comprehensive test file
- [ ] **High Priority**: Replace console logging with proper logging
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Make process.exit calls configurable
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Remove unused code
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Add usage examples

### Final Status
**Decision**: Keep - Excellent Core Design
**Reason**: Outstanding CLI runner with proper Effect integration and comprehensive execution flow. Well-designed orchestration of parsing, routing, and runtime execution. Only needs proper logging and tests to fully meet framework standards. The Effect integration and TUI runtime handling are particularly well done.
