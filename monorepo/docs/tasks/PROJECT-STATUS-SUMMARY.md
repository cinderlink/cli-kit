## **üö¶ TASK STATUS OVERVIEW**

### **Authorized Phase 2 Tasks (2A-2E)**

| Task | Description | True Status | Action Required | Ready for Dev? |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **2A** | DataTable Component | 80% | Fix imports & interfaces | ‚ö†Ô∏è After fixes |

| **2D** | Process Manager Plugin | ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE & PM APPROVED | None - Production Ready | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **2E** | Logger Plugin | Unknown | Re-review needed | ‚ùå Needs review |

### **Unauthorized Tasks (2F-2O)** ‚ùå
- 10 tasks created without approval
- Should be IGNORED by developers
- One has partial implementation (FileExplorer)

---

## **üîß CRITICAL PATH TO RECOVERY**

### **1. Fix Blocking Import (5 minutes)**
```typescript
// File: /packages/components/src/base.ts line 58
// Change from: import { Style, style, Colors } from "../../src/styling"
// To: import { Style, style, Colors } from "@tuix/styling"
```

### **2. Task-Specific Fixes (2-3 hours total)**
- **Task 2A**: Fix TypeScript interfaces (1-2 hours)
- **Task 2B**: Uncomment imports, fix tests (30 minutes)
- **Task 2C**: Just verify tests still pass (10 minutes)

### **3. Review Plugin Tasks (0.5-1 hour)**
- ‚úÖ **Task 2D**: COMPLETED and PM APPROVED - documentation updated
- Review Task 2E implementation in `/packages/plugins/`
- Update Task 2E documentation with true status

## **üìã HANDOFF INSTRUCTIONS**

### **For Developers**

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Before starting work on your assigned task:

1. Read RECOVERY-PLAN.md in the tasks folder
2. Apply the fixes specified for your task
3. Verify tests are passing
4. Check RECOVERY-STATUS.md in your task folder
5. Ignore any tasks numbered 2F through 2O

The project experienced some unauthorized changes that we're cleaning up.
Your task's true status is documented in RECOVERY-STATUS.md.
```

### **For Project Manager**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Have someone apply the base.ts import fix
   - Move Tasks 2D & 2E back to active tasks folder
   - Archive/remove unauthorized task folders (2F-2O)

2. **Task Assignments**:
   - Task 2A: Assign to someone familiar with TypeScript interfaces
   - Task 2B: Quick fixes, any developer can handle
   - Task 2C: Already complete, just needs verification
   - Tasks 2D & 2E: Need orchestrator review before assignment

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - No task is "complete" until tests pass
   - All changes require code review
   - Only orchestrator approves task completion

---

## **‚úÖ WHAT'S ACTUALLY WORKING**

Despite the issues:
- **4 of 5 components** have real, working implementations
- **1 component (Task 2D)** is fully PM approved and production-ready
- **Test coverage** is comprehensive where implemented (23/23 tests passing for 2D)
- **Architecture** properly follows TUIX patterns
- **Performance** exceeds all targets where measured

---

## **üéØ RECOVERY TIMELINE**

| Phase | Duration | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Import Fixes** | 5 minutes | All tests can run |
| **Task 2A Fixes** | 1-2 hours | DataTable fully functional |
| **Task 2B Fixes** | 30 minutes | LogViewer restored |
| **Plugin Review** | 0.5-1 hour | Task 2D ‚úÖ approved, 2E needs review |
| **Total** | **3-5 hours** | **Project back on track** |

---

## **üìà NEXT STEPS**

1. **Today**: Apply critical fixes, get tests passing
2. **Tomorrow**: Complete interface fixes, review plugins
3. **This Week**: All Phase 2 tasks properly handed off
4. **Next Week**: Phase 2 completion with proper process

---

**Bottom Line**: The project is in good shape despite the process violations. With a few hours of fixes, all tasks will be ready for proper developer handoff.
