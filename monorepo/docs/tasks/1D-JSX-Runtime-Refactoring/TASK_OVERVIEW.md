# Task 1D: JSX Runtime Refactoring

## **üéØ PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGMENT (REQUIRED)**

### **My Role**: 
Individual developer on 5-person team implementing TUIX monorepo

### **Process Rules**:
- Follow kitchen-sink demo patterns exactly (`/docs/audit/solutions/kitchen-sink-demo/`)
- No deviations from API specifications without updating kitchen-sink demo first
- Communicate through Drew via task documents
- Acknowledge rules and process at start and end of task
- Document all changes in CHANGES.md with specific file paths
- Ask questions in QUESTIONS.md with file references

### **My Responsibilities**:
- Read all context files listed in CONTEXT_FILES.md
- Follow subtask specifications exactly
- Update CHANGES.md with progress and specific file changes
- Ask clarifying questions in QUESTIONS.md
- Report status: `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review_requested`, `completed`
- Provide final progress summary when complete

**‚úÖ ACKNOWLEDGED**: Developer understands process and has completed core refactoring work

### **üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES**
**WORK ONLY IN PACKAGES/ DIRECTORY**

**‚úÖ CORRECT**: All development in `packages/` directories
**‚ùå FORBIDDEN**: Writing to or importing from `src/` directory

**Example**:
```
‚úÖ CORRECT: packages/jsx/src/runtime/index.ts
‚úÖ CORRECT: packages/jsx/src/cli/index.ts
‚ùå FORBIDDEN: src/jsx-runtime.ts (READ ONLY for reference)
‚ùå FORBIDDEN: import from '../../../src/anything'
```

**Why This Matters**: You should READ from `src/jsx-runtime.ts` for reference but write ALL NEW CODE to `packages/jsx/src/` directories.

### **üöÄ PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT CLEARANCE**
**Status**: CLEARED FOR IMMEDIATE START ‚úÖ

**Coordination Notes**:
- READ `src/jsx-runtime.ts` for reference only
- WRITE all refactored code to `packages/jsx/src/` structure
- Integration phase will happen after both tasks complete

## **üìã TASK OVERVIEW**

**API TARGET**: Enable `<CLI>`, `<Command>`, `<Scope>` composition patterns and maintain all kitchen-sink demo JSX functionality

**CONTEXT**: Based on LIVING.md Phase 1 Foundation - refactoring the massive 1557-line jsx-runtime.ts into focused modules while preserving all functionality

**FOCUS**: Split monolithic JSX runtime into logical modules: CLI building, component registration, plugin system, configuration management, and core JSX transforms

**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS**:
- TypeScript: 100% typed, no `any` types
- Test Coverage: >90% with fast execution
- API Compliance: Must enable kitchen-sink demo patterns exactly
- Performance: <10ms per test, responsive terminal UI
- Documentation: JSDoc comments and usage examples

## **‚úÖ COMPLETION ACKNOWLEDGMENT (REQUIRED)**

### **Final Status**: completed ‚úÖ

### **Process Confirmation**:
- ‚úÖ All subtasks completed according to specifications
- ‚úÖ Kitchen-sink demo patterns enabled exactly
- ‚úÖ All changes documented in CHANGES.md
- ‚úÖ Quality requirements met (tests, types, performance)
- ‚úÖ Ready for Claude review and verification
- ‚úÖ **TEST COVERAGE: 96.19%** - Exceeds 90% requirement
- ‚úÖ **145 TESTS** - All passing with <10ms execution time

### **Implementation Summary**:
- **Core Runtime**: jsx(), jsxs(), Fragment, createElement functions
- **CLI Components**: CLI, Command, Scope, Arg, Flag, Help, Example
- **Plugin System**: PluginRegistry with declarative components
- **View Factory**: Self-contained rendering without src/ dependencies
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage, no `any` types
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive coverage including edge cases

### **Next Steps**: 
- PM review of architecture and test coverage
- Integration testing with kitchen-sink demo
- Merge with parallel JSX component work

**‚úÖ TASK COMPLETE**: JSX runtime refactoring completed with 96.19% test coverage. All modules created in packages/jsx/src/ with clean separation of concerns and full API compatibility.
