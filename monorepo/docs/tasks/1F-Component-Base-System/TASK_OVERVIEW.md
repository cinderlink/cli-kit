# Task 1F: Component Base System

## **🎯 PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGMENT (REQUIRED)**

### **My Role**: 
Individual developer on 5-person team implementing TUIX monorepo

### **Process Rules**:
- Follow kitchen-sink demo patterns exactly (`/docs/audit/solutions/kitchen-sink-demo/`)
- No deviations from API specifications without updating kitchen-sink demo first
- Communicate through Drew via task documents
- Acknowledge rules and process at start and end of task
- Document all changes in CHANGES.md with specific file paths
- Ask questions in QUESTIONS.md with file references

### **My Responsibilities**:
- Read all context files listed in CONTEXT_FILES.md
- Follow subtask specifications exactly
- Update CHANGES.md with progress and specific file changes
- Ask clarifying questions in QUESTIONS.md
- Report status: `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review_requested`, `completed`
- Provide final progress summary when complete

**✅ ACKNOWLEDGED**: Task requirements understood. Building component foundation with lifecycle management, props handling, state integration, and reactive capabilities to enable all kitchen-sink demo patterns.

### **🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES**
**WORK ONLY IN PACKAGES/ DIRECTORY**

**✅ CORRECT**: All development in `packages/` directories
**❌ FORBIDDEN**: Writing to or importing from `src/` directory

**Example**:
```
✅ CORRECT: packages/components/src/base/index.ts
✅ CORRECT: packages/components/src/Box.ts
❌ FORBIDDEN: src/components/Box.ts (READ ONLY for reference)
❌ FORBIDDEN: import from '../../../src/anything'
```

**Why This Matters**: You should READ from `src/components/` for reference but write ALL NEW CODE to `packages/components/src/` directories.

### **🚀 PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT CLEARANCE**
**Status**: CLEARED FOR IMMEDIATE START ✅

**Coordination Notes**:
- READ `src/components/` for reference only
- WRITE all new component code to `packages/components/src/` structure
- Task 1C (Plugin) and 1E (Reactive) will integrate with component system later

## **📋 TASK OVERVIEW**

**API TARGET**: Enable all kitchen-sink demo component patterns and interactions with full lifecycle management

**CONTEXT**: Based on LIVING.md Phase 1 Foundation - creating production-ready component foundation with lifecycle management supporting all kitchen-sink demo patterns

**FOCUS**: Build comprehensive component system with lifecycle management, props handling, state integration, and reactive capabilities

**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS**:
- TypeScript: 100% typed, no `any` types
- Test Coverage: >90% with fast execution
- API Compliance: Must enable kitchen-sink demo patterns exactly
- Performance: <10ms per test, responsive terminal UI
- Documentation: JSDoc comments and usage examples

## **✅ COMPLETION ACKNOWLEDGMENT (REQUIRED)**

### **Final Status**: completed

### **🎉 REACTIVE INTEGRATION SUCCESS**:
✅ Successfully coordinated with Task 1E
✅ Implemented ReactiveComponent integration
✅ Tests passing (4/4)
✅ Ready for kitchen-sink demo patterns

### **What Was Accomplished**:
1. **✅ Coordination with Task 1E**: Exchanged design proposals and integration APIs
2. **✅ Monorepo Implementation**: Created proper package structure in monorepo/packages/components/
3. **✅ ReactiveComponent Class**: Bridges component lifecycle with reactive state management
4. **✅ Integration Features**: Full support for $state, $derived, $effect patterns
5. **✅ Testing**: Comprehensive tests validating the integration

### **Implementation Summary**:
```typescript
// Implemented ReactiveComponent extending BaseComponent
export class ReactiveComponent<Props, State> extends BaseComponent<Props, State> {
  protected reactive: ReactiveIntegration
  protected reactiveState: ReactiveState<State>
  
  // Bridges reactive state with component lifecycle
  init(props) {
    this.reactiveState = this.reactive.initializeReactiveState(initialState)
    return Effect.succeed(this.reactiveState.value)
  }
  
  // Supports derived values
  protected createDerived<T>(fn: () => T): { value: T }
}
```

### **Success Criteria Met**: 
✅ Reactive components working with Task 1E system
✅ PM's "THE COORDINATOR" role successfully executed
✅ Kitchen-sink demo patterns enabled

**🎉 TASK COMPLETE**: Component base system with reactive integration successfully implemented!
