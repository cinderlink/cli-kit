## **ü§î ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS**

### **Plugin Architecture**
- Should the logger plugin be always-on or lazily initialized?
- How should the plugin handle configuration changes at runtime?
- What metadata should the plugin provide about its capabilities?
- Should logging be synchronous or asynchronous by default?

### **Performance**
- What's the acceptable overhead for structured logging?
- Should we implement log batching for better performance?
- How to optimize file I/O for high-throughput scenarios?
- Should log formatting be done synchronously or asynchronously?

### **Output Management**
- How many concurrent file outputs should we support?
- Should log rotation be time-based, size-based, or both?
- How to handle disk space issues gracefully?
- What's the best strategy for log compression?

### **Streaming**
- How to handle backpressure in log streams?
- Should we limit the number of concurrent stream subscribers?
- How to ensure stream delivery without blocking the application?
- What's the best approach for filtering logs in streams?

### **Integration**
- How should Task 2B (LogViewer) consume log data from this plugin?
- Should the plugin provide hooks for log analysis?
- How to coordinate with other plugins that might also log?
- What events should the plugin emit during operation?

### **Error Handling**
- How to handle logging failures without affecting the application?
- Should we have a fallback logging mechanism?
- How to detect and recover from corrupted log files?
- What to do when disk space is exhausted?

## **üìù NOTES SECTION**

Use this space for any implementation notes, decisions, or discoveries that might help others.

### **Design Decisions**
- Structured logging with JSON by default for searchability
- Async file I/O to prevent blocking the main thread
- Circular buffer for in-memory log history
- Stream-based real-time log distribution

### **Performance Considerations**
- Minimize object allocation in hot logging paths
- Use efficient serialization for structured data
- Implement smart buffering to reduce I/O operations
- Consider memory usage for long-running applications

### **Reliability Patterns**
- Never throw exceptions from logging code
- Graceful degradation when outputs fail
- Self-monitoring for logging system health
- Recovery mechanisms for transient failures
