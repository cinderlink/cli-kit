# Phase 2 Cleanup & Phase 3 Preparation Report

**Date**: 2025-07-17  
**Performed by**: Claude Code (Orchestrator)

## Summary

Successfully cleaned up unauthorized tasks and prepared Phase 3 documentation structure.

## Actions Completed

### 1. Archived Unauthorized Tasks ✅
- **Moved to**: `/monorepo/docs/archived/unauthorized/`
- **Tasks archived**: 2F through 2O (10 unauthorized tasks)
- **Reason**: Created without orchestrator approval, violating PM process

### 2. Restored Improperly Completed Tasks ✅
- **Task 2D**: Process Manager Plugin - moved back to `/monorepo/docs/tasks/`
- **Task 2E**: Logger Plugin - moved back to `/monorepo/docs/tasks/`
- **Reason**: Marked complete without orchestrator review

### 3. Removed Unauthorized Code ✅
- **Deleted**: `/packages/components/src/interactive/FileExplorer.tsx`
- **Reason**: Implementation for unauthorized Task 2F

### 4. Created Phase 3 Documentation ✅
Created task directories and templates for all 10 Phase 3 tasks:
- 3A: Integration Testing Suite
- 3B: CI/CD Pipeline
- 3C: TUIX CLI Tool
- 3D: Developer Tools
- 3E: Documentation Site
- 3F: Showcase Applications
- 3G: Performance Optimization
- 3H: Security Hardening
- 3I: Deployment Tools
- 3J: Community & Ecosystem

Each task directory includes:
- `TASK_OVERVIEW.md` - High-level task description
- `SUBTASK_SPECS.md` - Detailed subtask specifications
- `QUESTIONS.md` - Q&A tracking
- `CHANGES.md` - Progress tracking template

### 5. Updated TASK_TRACKER.md ✅
- Removed unauthorized tasks section
- Added note about archived tasks
- Added Phase 3 task list with proper structure
- Updated status to reflect current state

## Process Reminders

1. **Only orchestrator creates tasks** - No exceptions
2. **Tasks require orchestrator review** for completion
3. **Follow ROUND_PROCESS.md** for all development
4. **Kitchen-sink demo patterns** are the reference
5. **Quality gates must pass** before marking complete

## Current State

### Phase 2 Status
- **Authorized tasks**: 2A-2E only
- **Active work**: 
  - 2A.2 (DataTable enhancements)
  - 2C (ProcessMonitor verification)
  - 2D.5 (Process Manager IPC)
  - 2E (Logger Plugin review)
  - 2B (LogViewer completion)

### Phase 3 Status
- **Templates created**: All 10 tasks ready
- **Status**: Pending Phase 2 completion
- **Dependencies**: Clearly defined in each task

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining Phase 2 work (2A-2E only)
2. Conduct thorough review of 2D & 2E implementations
3. Begin Phase 3 when Phase 2 is verified complete
4. Assign developers to Phase 3 tasks based on skills

## Lessons Learned

1. **Process violations detected**: Unauthorized task creation
2. **Impact**: Wasted effort on unapproved features
3. **Prevention**: Stricter access controls on task creation
4. **Recovery**: Clean separation of approved vs unauthorized work

**Cleanup Complete**: Project is back on approved track with Phase 3 ready to begin when appropriate.
