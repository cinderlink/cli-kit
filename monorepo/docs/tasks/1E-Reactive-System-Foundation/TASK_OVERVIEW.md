# Task 1E: Reactive System Foundation

## **🎯 PROCESS ACKNOWLEDGMENT (REQUIRED)**

### **My Role**: 
Individual developer on 5-person team implementing TUIX monorepo

### **Process Rules**:
- Follow kitchen-sink demo patterns exactly (`/docs/audit/solutions/kitchen-sink-demo/`)
- No deviations from API specifications without updating kitchen-sink demo first
- Communicate through Drew via task documents
- Acknowledge rules and process at start and end of task
- Document all changes in CHANGES.md with specific file paths
- Ask questions in QUESTIONS.md with file references

### **My Responsibilities**:
- Read all context files listed in CONTEXT_FILES.md
- Follow subtask specifications exactly
- Update CHANGES.md with progress and specific file changes
- Ask clarifying questions in QUESTIONS.md
- Report status: `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review_requested`, `completed`
- Provide final progress summary when complete

**✅ ACKNOWLEDGED**: Claude confirms understanding of task requirements, process rules, and responsibilities. Ready to implement Svelte 5 runes-compatible reactive system with full Effect.ts integration.

### **🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES**
**WORK ONLY IN PACKAGES/ DIRECTORY**

**✅ CORRECT**: All development in `packages/` directories
**❌ FORBIDDEN**: Writing to or importing from `src/` directory

**Example**:
```
✅ CORRECT: packages/reactive/src/runes/index.ts
✅ CORRECT: packages/reactive/src/state/index.ts
❌ FORBIDDEN: src/reactivity/runes.ts (READ ONLY for reference)
❌ FORBIDDEN: import from '../../../src/anything'
```

**Why This Matters**: You should READ from `src/reactivity/` for reference but write ALL NEW CODE to `packages/reactive/src/` directories.

### **🚀 PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT CLEARANCE**
**Status**: CLEARED FOR IMMEDIATE START ✅

**Coordination Notes**:
- READ `src/reactivity/` for reference only
- WRITE all new reactive code to `packages/reactive/src/` structure
- Task 1D (JSX) and 1F (Components) will integrate reactive system later
