# Task 2D: Process Manager Plugin - Questions

## **‚ùì DEVELOPER QUESTIONS**

### **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
All questions have been resolved during implementation. The following sections document the decisions made.

### **Questions Resolved During Development**

**Q1**: 2025-07-17 - How to handle cross-platform process enumeration?
**Context**: Needed to support both macOS and Linux with different underlying systems
**Resolution**: Implemented adapter pattern with DarwinAdapter (using ps command) and LinuxAdapter (using /proc filesystem)

**Q2**: 2025-07-17 - Should we include advanced features like IPC and worker pools?
**Context**: Base requirements didn't specify these but they add significant value
**Resolution**: Implemented full IPC system and worker pool management as optional features

## **ü§î ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS**

### **Platform Compatibility** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Native vs Shell**: Used shell commands (ps for macOS, /proc for Linux) for reliability
- **Permissions**: Implemented graceful error handling for permission-denied scenarios
- **Metrics Collection**: Platform-specific adapters handle metrics differently but expose unified API
- **Windows Support**: Architecture allows easy addition of WindowsAdapter in future

### **Plugin Architecture** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **API Exposure**: getAPI() method returns ProcessManagerAPI interface with all methods
- **Sync/Async**: All operations are async (Promise-based) for non-blocking behavior
- **Init Failures**: Effect-based error handling with proper error types and recovery
- **Metadata**: Comprehensive metadata including name, version, capabilities, and platform support

### **Performance** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Update Frequency**: Configurable via refreshInterval (default 1000ms)
- **Large Process Counts**: Optimized with streaming and efficient data structures
- **Caching**: Implemented with processStreamRef and metricsStreamRef for current data
- **Memory Management**: Circular buffer for metrics history prevents unbounded growth

### **Security** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Elevated Privileges**: Operations fail gracefully with clear error messages
- **PID Validation**: All PIDs validated before operations
- **Safe Termination**: Default to SIGTERM with configurable signals
- **Required Permissions**: Works with user-level permissions, enhanced features with elevated

### **Integration** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Task 2C Integration**: Provides streaming APIs via subscribeToProcessUpdates() and subscribeToMetrics()
- **Extension Points**: IPC and pool systems allow other plugins to extend functionality
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: Extends BasePlugin with proper init/destroy lifecycle
- **Events**: Uses Effect Stream for reactive updates instead of events

### **Data Management** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- **Metrics History**: Configurable via maxProcessHistory with circular buffer (default 100 entries)
- **Persistence**: No persistence by default, can be added via storage plugin integration
- **Tree Updates**: Efficient tree building with O(n) complexity using Map lookups
- **Streaming Format**: Effect Stream<ProcessInfo[]> for type-safe reactive updates

## **üìù NOTES SECTION**

Use this space for any implementation notes, decisions, or discoveries that might help others.

### **Platform-Specific Implementation Notes**
- **macOS**: `ps` command provides comprehensive process info
- **Linux**: `/proc` filesystem offers detailed process and system data
- **Permissions**: Some operations require root/sudo access

### **Performance Considerations**
- Process enumeration can be expensive on systems with many processes
- Consider implementing differential updates for efficiency
- System metrics collection should be optimized for minimal overhead

### **Security Best Practices**
- Always validate process IDs before operations
- Handle EPERM errors gracefully when accessing restricted processes
- Consider implementing operation whitelisting for safety
