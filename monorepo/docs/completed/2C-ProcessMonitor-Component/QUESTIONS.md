## **üìù NOTES SECTION**

Use this space for any implementation notes, decisions, or discoveries that might help others.

### **Platform-Specific Considerations**
- macOS: Use `ps` command or native system calls
- Linux: Parse `/proc` filesystem or use `ps`
- Windows: Not initially supported, but design for future extension

### **Security Considerations**
- Process management requires appropriate permissions
- Validate PIDs before performing actions
- Handle EPERM errors gracefully
- Consider running with elevated privileges warnings
