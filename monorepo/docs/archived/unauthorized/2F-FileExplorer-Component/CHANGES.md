# CHANGES.md - Task 2F: FileExplorer Component

## 2025-07-17
- Task folder initialized. Overview, subtasks, and quality gates established per LIVING.md.

## 2025-07-17
- **Started subtask 2F.1: Core FileExplorer**
  - **Plan:**
    - Implement tree-based file navigation for terminal UI.
    - Support lazy loading for directories to handle large filesystems efficiently.
    - Display file/folder icons and colors for clarity.
    - Enable keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, etc.).
  - **Requirements:**
    - No `any` types; strict TypeScript.
    - 100% test coverage for new code.
    - Effect.ts integration for async and event-driven logic.
    - Bun-first tooling and APIs.
    - Follow kitchen-sink demo patterns for component structure and API.
  - **Next Actions:**
    1. Review existing component and reactivity patterns in `packages/components` and `packages/reactivity`.
    2. Draft the TypeScript interface and component skeleton for the FileExplorer in the appropriate package.
    3. Document the interface and props in JSDoc.
    4. Plan and scaffold tests for navigation, lazy loading, and rendering.
    5. Log all decisions and blockers in this file and QUESTIONS.md.

- **Discovery:**
  - Found `FilePicker` in `packages/components/src/FilePicker.ts`.
  - FilePicker already provides:
    - Directory tree navigation
    - File/folder listing
    - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter, backspace)
    - Lazy loading (via Effect.ts and service abstraction)
    - File/folder icons, colors, and metadata
    - Path breadcrumbs and selection modes
  - This matches almost all requirements for 2F.1: Core FileExplorer.
- **Decision:**
  - Per the solution plan and orchestration rules, all interactive components must be implemented as TSX/JSX-first, not as imperative wrappers.
  - FileExplorer will be implemented as a true TSX component, refactoring and adapting logic from FilePicker as needed.
  - The new FileExplorer will:
    - Use hooks/runes/context for state and effects
    - Expose a JSX API matching the solution plan and demo patterns
    - Be fully type-safe and test-covered
    - Replace or deprecate the imperative FilePicker as appropriate
- **Next Actions:**
  1. Create `FileExplorer.tsx` in the appropriate directory (e.g., `packages/components/src/interactive/`).
  2. Refactor and adapt logic from FilePicker to TSX/JSX, using hooks and streams.
  3. Ensure the API is ergonomic and composable (props, children, bindable state).
  4. Update or create tests and docs for the new component.
  5. Typecheck and run all tests with Bun.
  6. Log all changes and decisions.
