# CLI Module Planning

## üéØ Current Focus

### Active Development
- Plugin system stabilization and performance
- Lazy loading implementation for large CLI applications
- Command suggestion and autocomplete system
- Advanced help generation with examples

### This Week's Goals
- Complete plugin lifecycle management
- Implement robust command routing with middleware
- Add comprehensive CLI testing utilities
- Improve error messages and user experience

## üóìÔ∏è Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core CLI Framework
- [x] Basic command definition and routing
- [x] Argument and flag parsing with Zod validation
- [ ] Plugin system with dependency resolution
- [ ] Lazy loading for improved startup performance
- [ ] Advanced help system with usage examples

### Phase 2: Developer Experience
- [ ] Interactive command builder
- [ ] CLI application scaffolding tools
- [ ] Command suggestion and fuzzy matching
- [ ] Shell completion generation
- [ ] Configuration file management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Subcommand nesting and delegation
- [ ] Command pipelines and composition
- [ ] Interactive prompts and wizards
- [ ] CLI application analytics
- [ ] Multi-language support

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Command Definition
- **Decision**: Use configuration objects with Zod schemas
- **Rationale**: Type-safe validation with runtime checks
- **Impact**: Better error messages but requires Zod knowledge

### Plugin System
- **Decision**: Plugin lifecycle management with dependencies
- **Rationale**: Enables complex plugin ecosystems
- **Impact**: More complex but enables powerful extensibility

### Lazy Loading
- **Decision**: Module-level lazy loading with intelligent caching
- **Rationale**: Faster startup for large applications
- **Impact**: Complexity in module resolution but much better UX

### JSX Integration
- **Decision**: Declarative CLI definition using JSX components
- **Rationale**: Familiar syntax for component-based thinking
- **Impact**: Learning curve but very powerful for complex CLIs

## üîÑ Refactoring Plans

### Plugin System Improvements
- Simplify plugin registration API
- Add plugin validation and compatibility checking
- Implement plugin marketplace and discovery
- Add plugin configuration management

### Command Router Optimization
- Implement command caching for repeated lookups
- Add route precompilation for performance
- Optimize argument parsing pipeline
- Add command execution metrics

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Standardize error message formats
- Add error recovery suggestions
- Implement error reporting and analytics
- Add debugging modes for troubleshooting

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 85%
- Integration Tests: 80%
- CLI E2E Tests: 90%

### Missing Tests
- Plugin lifecycle edge cases
- Lazy loading error scenarios
- Command suggestion accuracy
- Performance regression tests
- CLI application integration tests

### Testing Improvements
- Add CLI application testing framework
- Create mock plugin ecosystem for testing
- Implement performance benchmarking
- Add visual testing for help output
