# Model Module Planning

## Future Development

### 1. Advanced Event System
- **Event Sourcing**: Full event sourcing support
- **Event Replay**: Replay events for debugging
- **Event Persistence**: Store events for audit trails
- **Event Versioning**: Handle event schema evolution
- **Event Routing**: Advanced routing and filtering

### 2. Enhanced Scope Features
- **Scope Inheritance**: Prototype-based scope inheritance
- **Scope Persistence**: Save and restore scope state
- **Scope Visualization**: Visual scope hierarchy debugging
- **Scope Policies**: Access control and permissions
- **Distributed Scopes**: Cross-process scope synchronization

### 3. State Management Evolution
- **State Machines**: Integrated XState support
- **CRDT Support**: Conflict-free replicated data types
- **State Synchronization**: Multi-client state sync
- **Optimistic Updates**: Client-side prediction
- **State Validation**: Runtime state shape validation

### 4. Reactive Patterns
- **Computed Properties**: Derived state calculations
- **State Observers**: Fine-grained change detection
- **Reactive Queries**: Live query results
- **State Subscriptions**: Selective state updates
- **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic dependency graphs

### 5. Developer Experience
- **Model Devtools**: Visual state and event debugging
- **Code Generation**: Generate types from schemas
- **Migration Tools**: Automated state migrations
- **Testing Utilities**: Model-specific test helpers
- **Documentation Generation**: Auto-generate model docs

## Design Principles

1. **Immutability**: All state must be immutable
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type inference
3. **Performance**: Efficient change detection and updates
4. **Debugging**: Excellent debugging and inspection tools
5. **Composability**: Models should compose naturally

## API Evolution

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

## Technical Considerations

- Memory efficiency for large event streams
- Performance of scope lookups
- State serialization strategies
- Garbage collection of old events
- Type inference performance
