# Model Module Issues

## Known Issues

### 1. Event Bus Memory Leaks
- **Issue**: Subscribers not properly cleaned up
- **Impact**: Memory grows over time in long-running apps
- **Solution**: Implement automatic subscription cleanup

### 2. Scope Performance
- **Issue**: Deep scope hierarchies cause slow lookups
- **Impact**: Performance degradation with nested components
- **Solution**: Implement scope lookup caching

### 3. Event Type Safety
- **Issue**: Event payloads are not fully type-safe
- **Impact**: Runtime errors from malformed events
- **Solution**: Implement compile-time event validation

### 4. State Isolation
- **Issue**: State can leak between scopes
- **Impact**: Unexpected state mutations
- **Solution**: Enforce stricter scope boundaries

### 5. Missing Event Replay
- **Issue**: Cannot replay events for debugging
- **Impact**: Hard to debug complex event flows
- **Solution**: Add event recording and replay system

## Improvements Needed

### High Priority

1. **Memory Management**
   - Automatic subscription cleanup
   - Event buffer limits
   - Scope garbage collection

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Scope lookup caching
   - Event batching
   - Lazy state evaluation

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Better error messages
   - Event flow visualization
   - State debugging tools

### Medium Priority

1. **Type Safety**
   - Stricter event typing
   - Runtime validation
   - Schema enforcement

2. **Testing Support**
   - Event testing utilities
   - Scope mocking helpers
   - State snapshot testing

3. **Documentation**
   - More usage examples
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Best practices guide

### Low Priority

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Event sourcing
   - Time-travel debugging
   - State persistence

2. **Integration**
   - Redux DevTools support
   - State migration tools
   - External store adapters

## Technical Debt

1. **Event Bus Implementation**: Current implementation could be more efficient
2. **Scope Manager**: Too much responsibility in single class
3. **Type Definitions**: Some types use `any` or are too permissive
4. **Test Coverage**: Event system lacks comprehensive tests
5. **Documentation**: API documentation is incomplete

## Future Considerations

- WebAssembly for performance-critical paths
- Service worker integration for offline state
- Blockchain integration for distributed state
- Machine learning for predictive state updates
- GraphQL subscriptions for real-time sync
