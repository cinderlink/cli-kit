# Input Module Planning

## Future Development

### 1. Enhanced Keyboard Support
- **Keyboard Layouts**: Support for international layouts
- **Custom Key Bindings**: User-configurable shortcuts
- **Vim Mode**: Full vim keybinding support
- **Macro Recording**: Record and replay key sequences
- **Chorded Keys**: Support for complex key combinations

### 2. Advanced Mouse Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: Swipe, pinch, and custom gestures
- **Drag and Drop**: Full DnD support with visual feedback
- **Mouse Wheel**: Smooth scrolling and zoom support
- **Multi-button Mouse**: Support for additional mouse buttons
- **Pointer Capture**: Lock pointer for games/drawing apps

### 3. Touch Support
- **Touch Events**: Basic touch input for touch-enabled terminals
- **Multi-touch**: Gesture support for modern terminals
- **Touch Keyboard**: On-screen keyboard for touch devices
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibration feedback where supported

### 4. Accessibility Enhancements
- **Screen Reader Integration**: Full NVDA/JAWS support
- **Switch Control**: Single-switch navigation
