# Services Module Compliance Report

## Overview
The services module has been moved from `/src/services/` to `/src/core/services/`. This report documents compliance issues and recommendations based on the framework's RULES.md, STANDARDS.md, and CONVENTIONS.md.

## Current Structure
```
src/core/services/
├── events/
│   └── types.ts          # Event type definitions
├── impl/
│   ├── index.ts          # Service implementations exports
│   ├── input.ts          # Input service implementation
│   ├── renderer.ts       # Renderer service implementation
│   ├── storage.ts        # Storage service implementation
│   ├── storage/          # Storage implementation details
│   └── terminal.ts       # Terminal service implementation
├── index.ts              # Public API exports
├── input.ts              # Input service interface
├── renderer.ts           # Renderer service interface
├── service-module.ts     # Module coordinator
├── storage.ts            # Storage service interface
└── terminal.ts           # Terminal service interface
```

## Compliance Issues

### 1. File Naming Convention Fixed ✅
**Previously**: Used `-impl` suffix which violated the Single Implementation Principle
**Fixed**: Renamed files to remove the `-impl` suffix:
- `input-impl.ts` → `input.ts`
- `renderer-impl.ts` → `renderer.ts`
- `storage-impl.ts` → `storage.ts`
- `terminal-impl.ts` → `terminal.ts`

**Rule Compliance**: Now follows the Single Implementation Principle

### 2. Missing Documentation ❌
**Issue**: No README.md, ISSUES.md, or PLANNING.md files in the services directory
- Missing module-level documentation explaining the service architecture
- No usage examples or API documentation
- No known issues tracking

**Rule Violated**: Module documentation structure requirements
**Recommendation**: Add required documentation files

### 3. Missing Test Coverage ❌
**Issue**: No test files found for any service implementations
- No unit tests for service implementations
- No integration tests for service interactions
- No test harness for service mocking

**Rule Violated**: "ALWAYS maintain 80% test coverage"
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive test suite

### 4. Module Re-location Without Cleanup ⚠️
**Issue**: Services moved to `/src/core/services/` but old location still tracked in git
- Old files deleted but not committed
- Potential confusion about the canonical location

**Recommendation**: Complete the migration by committing the deletions

## Positive Compliance ✅

### 1. Effect.ts Usage
- All services properly use Effect for async operations
- Service interfaces defined as Effect.Tag for dependency injection
- Proper error handling with typed errors (InputError, TerminalError)
- Layer composition for service dependencies

### 2. TypeScript Standards
- No `any` types found
- Proper type definitions and interfaces
- Good use of discriminated unions for event types
- Readonly properties where appropriate

### 3. Module Architecture
- Clean separation between interfaces and implementations
- Proper use of Effect's Context.Tag for service definitions
- Good event-driven architecture with ServiceModule
- Clear service boundaries and responsibilities

### 4. Platform Abstraction
- Good abstraction over Node.js APIs (stdin/stdout)
- Bun-compatible implementation approach

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Restructure files to eliminate `-impl` suffix pattern**
   - Option 1: Merge interface and implementation
   - Option 2: Use `live.ts` suffix for implementations
   - Option 3: Use nested structure (e.g., `terminal/live.ts`)

2. **Add required documentation**
   - Create `/src/core/services/README.md`
   - Create `/src/core/services/ISSUES.md`
   - Create `/src/core/services/PLANNING.md`

3. **Add comprehensive test suite**
   - Unit tests for each service
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - Test utilities for mocking services

4. **Complete the migration**
   - Commit the deletion of old `/src/services/` files
   - Update any imports that might still reference the old location

### Code Quality Improvements:
1. **Service Implementation Pattern**: Consider using a consistent pattern for all services
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure all errors are properly typed and handled
3. **Event Types**: Move event types to a more centralized location if they're used across modules

## Summary
The services module shows good architectural design and proper use of Effect.ts, but violates several framework conventions around file naming, documentation, and testing. The `-impl` suffix pattern is the most critical issue to address as it directly violates the Single Implementation Principle.
