## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### View System
- **Decision**: Use immutable view trees with structural sharing
- **Rationale**: Enables efficient diffing and prevents race conditions
- **Impact**: Requires careful memory management but provides predictable updates

### Error Handling
- **Decision**: All operations return Effect types with proper error modeling
- **Rationale**: Enables composable error handling and recovery
- **Impact**: Better reliability but requires Effect-TS knowledge

### Component Lifecycle
- **Decision**: Explicit lifecycle phases with cleanup guarantees
- **Rationale**: Prevents resource leaks and ensures proper teardown
- **Impact**: More boilerplate but much more reliable

## üîÑ Refactoring Plans

### View Tree Optimization
- Implement view recycling for better performance
- Add view memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize string width calculations
- Reduce object allocations in hot paths

### Type Safety Improvements
- Strengthen type constraints on component interfaces
- Add branded types for better runtime safety
- Improve error message quality
- Add exhaustiveness checking for message handling
