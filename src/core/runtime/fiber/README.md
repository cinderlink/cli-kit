# Fiber Runtime Module

This directory is reserved for Effect fiber integration and concurrent execution support.

## Purpose

The `fiber/` directory will contain:
- Effect fiber management utilities
- Concurrent execution patterns
- Fiber-local state management
- Structured concurrency helpers

## Status

Currently empty - will be populated as fiber-based features are implemented.

## Planned Features

1. **Fiber Management**
   - Fiber pool implementation
   - Fiber supervision trees
   - Cancellation propagation
   - Error boundaries

2. **Concurrency Patterns**
   - Fork-join parallelism
   - Racing operations
   - Timeout handling
   - Resource sharing

3. **State Management**
   - Fiber-local storage
   - Context propagation
   - State isolation
   - Memory cleanup

4. **Integration**
   - Component fiber mapping
   - Event fiber coordination
   - Service fiber lifecycle
   - Test fiber utilities

## Design Principles

- Follow Effect's fiber model
- Ensure proper cleanup
- Prevent fiber leaks
- Support debugging
