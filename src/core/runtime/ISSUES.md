# Runtime Module Issues

## Known Issues

### 1. Memory Management
- **Issue**: Long-running applications show gradual memory increase
- **Impact**: Performance degradation over time
- **Workaround**: Periodic application restart
- **Solution**: Implement proper cleanup in lifecycle hooks

### 2. Error Boundaries
- **Issue**: Errors in one component can crash entire runtime
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, lost application state
- **Workaround**: Wrap components in try-catch
- **Solution**: Implement React-style error boundaries

### 3. Hot Reload Limitations
- **Issue**: State is lost during module reloads
- **Impact**: Slower development iteration
- **Workaround**: Manual state persistence
- **Solution**: Implement state preservation during HMR

### 4. Fiber Context Loss
- **Issue**: Effect context is not properly propagated in some cases
- **Impact**: Services may be unavailable in components
- **Workaround**: Manually provide context
- **Solution**: Deep integration with Effect's fiber system

## Improvements Needed

### High Priority

1. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add runtime performance metrics
   - Identify slow render paths
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Component render timing

2. **Error Recovery**
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Graceful degradation
   - Error reporting system
   - Recovery strategies

3. **State Management**
   - State persistence APIs
   - Time-travel debugging
   - State snapshots
   - Undo/redo support

### Medium Priority

1. **Developer Tools**
   - Runtime inspector
   - Component tree viewer
   - Performance profiler
   - State debugger

2. **Module System**
   - Dynamic module loading
   - Module hot swapping
   - Dependency injection
   - Module isolation

3. **Concurrency**
   - Concurrent rendering
   - Priority scheduling
   - Suspense support
   - Streaming updates

### Low Priority

1. **Platform Features**
   - WebAssembly support
   - Worker thread integration
   - Native module support
   - GPU acceleration

2. **Advanced Patterns**
   - Plugin sandboxing
   - Resource quotas
   - Custom schedulers
   - Runtime extensions

## Technical Debt

1. **Global State**: Some runtime state is stored globally
2. **Type Safety**: Runtime type checking could be improved
3. **Test Coverage**: MVU runtime needs more comprehensive tests
4. **Documentation**: Runtime internals need better documentation
5. **Module Coupling**: Some modules are too tightly coupled

## Performance Bottlenecks

1. **Render Reconciliation**: Inefficient diff algorithm
2. **Event Handling**: Synchronous event processing
3. **State Updates**: No batching of updates
4. **Memory Allocation**: Excessive object creation

## Future Considerations

- Migration to fully concurrent architecture
- Support for server-side rendering
- Integration with build-time optimizations
- Runtime code splitting strategies
- Cross-platform compatibility layer
