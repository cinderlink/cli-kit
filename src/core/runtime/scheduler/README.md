# Scheduler Runtime Module

This directory is reserved for task scheduling and execution prioritization.

## Purpose

The `scheduler/` directory will contain:
- Task scheduling algorithms
- Priority queue implementations
- Execution timing control
- Resource allocation strategies

## Status

Currently empty - will be populated as advanced scheduling features are needed.

## Planned Features

1. **Task Scheduling**
   - Priority-based scheduling
   - Deadline scheduling
   - Fair queuing
   - Batch processing

2. **Performance**
   - CPU yield points
   - Frame budget management
   - Idle time utilization
   - Work stealing

3. **Coordination**
   - Multi-fiber scheduling
   - Event loop integration
   - I/O scheduling
   - Timer management

4. **Monitoring**
   - Task metrics
   - Queue depth tracking
   - Latency measurement
   - Throughput analysis

## Design Principles

- Maintain responsiveness
- Prevent starvation
- Support cancellation
- Enable profiling
