# Runtime Module Planning

## Future Development

### 1. Runtime Architecture Evolution
- **Fiber-based Execution**: Full integration with Effect's fiber model
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Support for concurrent UI updates
- **Streaming Rendering**: Progressive rendering for large outputs
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Pause rendering while loading data

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **JIT Compilation**: Optimize hot paths at runtime
- **Memory Pooling**: Reuse objects to reduce GC pressure
- **Lazy Module Loading**: Load modules on demand
- **Tree Shaking**: Remove unused code paths at runtime

### 3. Platform Integrations
- **Bun-specific Optimizations**: Leverage Bun's native APIs
- **WebAssembly Support**: Run WASM modules in the runtime
- **Worker Thread Pool**: Offload heavy computation
- **Native Extensions**: Support for native addons

### 4. Developer Experience
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Update code without restart
- **Time-travel Debugging**: Step through state changes
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in profiler integration
- **Runtime Inspection**: Inspect running application state

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Plugin Sandboxing**: Secure plugin execution environment
- **Resource Quotas**: Limit CPU/memory per component
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback for unsupported features
- **Runtime Migrations**: Update running applications

## Design Principles

1. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Runtime features shouldn't impact performance
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Advanced features are opt-in
3. **Platform Agnostic**: Core runtime works everywhere
4. **Debuggability**: Easy to understand and debug
5. **Extensibility**: Support for custom runtime extensions

## API Evolution

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic MVU runtime
- Module system
- Bootstrap process

### Phase 2: Concurrency
- Fiber integration
- Concurrent updates
- Streaming support

### Phase 3: Optimization
- JIT compilation
- Memory management
- Performance monitoring

### Phase 4: Advanced
- Plugin sandboxing
- Hot reloading
- Runtime inspection

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain compatibility with Effect's execution model
- Ensure deterministic behavior across platforms
- Support both development and production modes
- Enable progressive adoption of new features
- Provide migration paths for breaking changes
