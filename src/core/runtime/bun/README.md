# Bun Runtime Module

This directory is reserved for Bun-specific runtime optimizations and integrations.

## Purpose

The `bun/` directory will contain:
- Bun-specific performance optimizations
- Native Bun API integrations
- Bun runtime feature detection
- Platform-specific implementations

## Status

Currently empty - will be populated as Bun-specific optimizations are identified and implemented.

## Planned Features

1. **Native APIs**
   - Direct Bun.file() usage
   - Bun.spawn() process management
   - Bun SQLite integration
   - Native WebSocket support

2. **Performance**
   - Bun-specific JIT hints
   - Memory management optimizations
   - Fast path implementations
   - Native module loading

3. **Development**
   - Bun-specific hot reload
   - Debug protocol integration
   - Performance profiling
   - Native test runner integration

## Design Principles

- Leverage Bun's unique features
- Maintain compatibility with standard APIs
- Provide fallbacks for other runtimes
- Document performance gains
