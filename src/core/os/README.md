# Core OS Module

This directory is reserved for operating system abstractions and platform-specific implementations.

## Purpose

The `os/` directory will contain:
- Platform detection utilities
- OS-specific terminal capabilities
- File system abstractions
- Process management helpers
- Platform-specific optimizations

## Status

Currently empty - will be populated as platform-specific code is extracted from other modules and centralized here.

## Planned Features

1. **Platform Detection**
   - Runtime OS detection
   - Feature capability checking
   - Environment detection

2. **Terminal Abstractions**
   - OS-specific ANSI support
   - Terminal size detection
   - Color support detection

3. **File System**
   - Path normalization
   - File permissions handling
   - Symbolic link support

4. **Process Management**
   - Signal handling
   - Process spawning
   - IPC abstractions

## Design Principles

- Provide consistent API across platforms
- Fail gracefully on unsupported platforms
- Use Bun's built-in APIs where possible
- Minimize platform-specific code paths
