# Context Module Issues

## Known Issues

### 1. Limited Context Types
- **Issue**: Currently only supports component context
- **Impact**: Other cross-cutting concerns require prop drilling
- **Solution**: Implement additional context types as outlined in PLANNING.md

### 2. No Context Devtools
- **Issue**: Difficult to debug context state and updates
- **Impact**: Developer experience is suboptimal for complex apps
- **Solution**: Create context inspection tools and debugging utilities

### 3. Performance Concerns
- **Issue**: Every context update triggers all consumers
- **Impact**: Potential performance bottlenecks in large applications
- **Solution**: Implement selective subscription mechanism

### 4. Testing Complexity
- **Issue**: Testing components with context requires boilerplate
- **Impact**: Tests are verbose and harder to maintain
- **Solution**: Create testing utilities and mock providers

## Improvements Needed

### High Priority

1. **Context Value Memoization**
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders when context value hasn't changed
   - Use Effect's built-in equality checks

2. **Better Error Messages**
   - More descriptive errors when context is missing
   - Runtime validation of context values

3. **Documentation Examples**
   - More real-world usage examples
   - Best practices guide

### Medium Priority

1. **Context Composition Patterns**
   - Document how to compose multiple contexts
   - Provide utility functions for common patterns

2. **Migration Guide**
   - Guide for migrating from prop drilling to context
   - Performance considerations and trade-offs

3. **Integration Tests**
   - More comprehensive integration tests with MVU runtime
   - Cross-module context usage tests

### Low Priority

1. **Context Metrics**
   - Track context usage and update frequency
   - Performance profiling integration

2. **Alternative Implementations**
   - Research other context implementation strategies
   - Benchmark against current FiberRef approach

## Technical Debt

1. **Type Inference**: Some generic constraints could be improved for better type inference
2. **Error Handling**: Need more granular error types for different failure modes
3. **Memory Management**: Ensure proper cleanup of context subscriptions
4. **Documentation**: API documentation could be more comprehensive

## Future Considerations

- Support for async context values
- Context transformers and middlewares
- Cross-process context synchronization
- WebWorker context bridging
