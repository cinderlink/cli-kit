# Context Module Planning

## Future Development

### 1. Additional Context Types
- **Theme Context**: For managing theme state across the application
- **Configuration Context**: For runtime configuration access
- **Debug Context**: For debug mode state and tools
- **User Context**: For user preferences and settings

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement context value memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Add selective subscription mechanism for fine-grained updates
- Introduce context batching for multiple updates

### 3. Developer Experience
- Create context devtools for debugging context state
- Add TypeScript code generation for strongly-typed contexts
- Implement context validation and runtime checks

### 4. Integration Improvements
- Better integration with the scope system
- Support for context persistence across sessions
- Context middleware for cross-cutting concerns (logging, analytics)

### 5. Advanced Features
- Context time-travel debugging
- Context replay for testing
- Distributed context synchronization for multi-window apps

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: All contexts must be fully typed with no `any` usage
2. **Performance**: Context updates should be efficient and batched
3. **Composability**: Contexts should compose well with each other
4. **Testability**: Easy to mock and test in isolation
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and debugging tools

## API Evolution

### Phase 1: Core Context System (Current)
- Basic component context for MVU integration
- FiberRef-based implementation

### Phase 2: Extended Context Types
- Theme and configuration contexts
- Context providers and consumers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Context middleware
- Time-travel debugging
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration
- Plugin context API
- Cross-module context sharing
- Context persistence layer

## Technical Considerations

- Maintain compatibility with Effect's fiber model
- Ensure proper cleanup and memory management
- Support for SSR/SSG scenarios in the future
- Integration with the coordination module for complex workflows
