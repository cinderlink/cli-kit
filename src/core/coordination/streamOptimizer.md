# Event Stream Optimization

## Overview

Event Stream Optimization provides stream optimization techniques including buffering, batching, throttling, deduplication, and smart filtering for high-frequency events. This helps improve performance and reduce resource consumption when dealing with large volumes of events.

## Key Concepts

### Buffering
Buffering collects events in memory until a certain threshold is reached, then processes them in batches. This reduces the overhead of processing individual events.

### Throttling
Throttling limits the rate at which events are processed, preventing system overload during high-frequency event bursts.

### Deduplication
Deduplication identifies and removes duplicate events, reducing unnecessary processing.

## Usage

```typescript
import { EventStreamOptimizer } from '@core/coordination'

const optimizer = new EventStreamOptimizer(eventBus)

// Configure buffering
optimizer.configureBuffering('log-channel', 100) // Buffer 100 events before flushing

// Configure rate limiting
optimizer.configureRateLimit('ui-update-channel', 10) // Max 10 events per second

// Configure deduplication
optimizer.configureDeduplication('status-channel', (a, b) => a.payload.status === b.payload.status)
```

## API

### `configureBuffering(channel: string, size: number): Effect<void, CoordinationError>`
Configures buffering for a specific event channel.

### `configureRateLimit(channel: string, limit: number): Effect<void, CoordinationError>`
Configures rate limiting for a specific event channel.

### `configureDeduplication(channel: string, comparator: (a: BaseEvent, b: BaseEvent) => boolean): Effect<void, CoordinationError>`
Configures deduplication for a specific event channel.

### `getOptimizationStats(): Effect<OptimizationStats, CoordinationError>`
Gets statistics about the current optimization configuration.
