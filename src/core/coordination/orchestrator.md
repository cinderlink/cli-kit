# Workflow Orchestration

## Overview

Workflow Orchestration handles high-level workflow orchestration with error handling and state management. It provides a structured approach to defining and executing complex workflows with multiple steps.

## Key Concepts

### Workflow
A workflow is a named sequence of steps that are executed in order. Each workflow has a unique ID and can be executed multiple times with different parameters.

### Step
A step is a single unit of work within a workflow. Steps can have dependencies on other steps and can define error handling strategies.

### Error Handling
Workflows support configurable error handling strategies, including retry logic, fallback steps, and circuit breaker patterns.

## Usage

```typescript
import { WorkflowOrchestrator } from '@core/coordination'

const orchestrator = new WorkflowOrchestrator(eventBus)

// Define a workflow
const workflowConfig = {
  id: 'deployment-workflow',
  name: 'Deployment Workflow',
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'validate-config',
      name: 'Validate Configuration',
      handler: validateConfig
    },
    {
      id: 'deploy-app',
      name: 'Deploy Application',
      handler: deployApp,
      dependencies: ['validate-config']
    }
  ]
}

// Execute the workflow
const result = await orchestrator.executeWorkflow('deployment-workflow', workflowConfig)
```

## API

### `executeWorkflow(id: string, config: WorkflowConfig): Effect<WorkflowResult, WorkflowError>`
Executes a workflow with the given configuration.

### `cancelWorkflow(id: string): Effect<void, WorkflowError>`
Cancels a running workflow.

### `getWorkflowStatus(id: string): Effect<WorkflowStatus, CoordinationError>`
Gets the current status of a workflow.
