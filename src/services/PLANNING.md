## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Service Facade Design
```typescript
// Core service facade interface
interface ServiceFacade<T> {
  readonly name: string
  readonly status: ServiceStatus
  readonly config: ServiceConfig
  
  initialize(config?: Partial<ServiceConfig>): Promise<void>
  health(): Promise<HealthStatus>
  metrics(): Promise<ServiceMetrics>
  cleanup(): Promise<void>
  
  // Service-specific operations
  service: T
}

// Service registry
interface ServiceRegistry {
  register<T>(name: string, factory: ServiceFactory<T>): void
  resolve<T>(name: string): Promise<ServiceFacade<T>>
  list(): ServiceInfo[]
  shutdown(): Promise<void>
}

// Coordination engine
interface ServiceCoordinator {
  batch<T>(operations: ServiceOperation[]): Promise<T[]>
  transaction<T>(operations: ServiceOperation[]): Promise<T>
  pipeline<T>(operations: ServiceOperation[]): AsyncIterable<T>
}
```

### Performance Monitoring Architecture
```typescript
// Performance monitoring framework
interface PerformanceMonitor {
  track<T>(operation: string, fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T>
  metrics(service?: string): Promise<ServiceMetrics>
  alert(condition: AlertCondition): void
  dashboard(): PerformanceDashboard
}

// Real-time metrics collection
interface MetricsCollector {
  record(metric: MetricData): void
  aggregate(timeWindow: TimeWindow): AggregatedMetrics
  export(format: 'prometheus' | 'json' | 'csv'): string
}
```

### Service Configuration System
```typescript
// Configuration management
interface ConfigurationManager {
  load(environment: string): Promise<ServiceConfig>
  watch(callback: (config: ServiceConfig) => void): void
  update(path: string, value: any): Promise<void>
  validate(config: ServiceConfig): ValidationResult
}

// Environment-based configuration
interface EnvironmentConfig {
  development: ServiceConfig
  testing: ServiceConfig
  staging: ServiceConfig
  production: ServiceConfig
}
```

## üéõÔ∏è Implementation Specifications

### Service Facade Implementation
```typescript
abstract class BaseServiceFacade<T> implements ServiceFacade<T> {
  constructor(
    public readonly name: string,
    protected factory: ServiceFactory<T>,
    protected config: ServiceConfig
  ) {}
  
  async initialize(config?: Partial<ServiceConfig>): Promise<void> {
    this.config = { ...this.config, ...config }
    this.service = await this.factory(this.config)
    this.status = ServiceStatus.Ready
  }
  
  async health(): Promise<HealthStatus> {
    // Implementation with timeout and error handling
  }
  
  async metrics(): Promise<ServiceMetrics> {
    // Performance metrics collection
  }
}

// Specific service facades
class TerminalServiceFacade extends BaseServiceFacade<TerminalService> {
  async write(data: string): Promise<void> {
    return this.monitor('write', () => this.service.write(data))
  }
  
  async getDimensions(): Promise<Dimensions> {
    return this.monitor('getDimensions', () => this.service.getDimensions())
  }
}
```

### Service Registry Implementation
```typescript
class DefaultServiceRegistry implements ServiceRegistry {
  private services = new Map<string, ServiceFacade<any>>()
  private factories = new Map<string, ServiceFactory<any>>()
  
  register<T>(name: string, factory: ServiceFactory<T>): void {
    this.factories.set(name, factory)
  }
  
  async resolve<T>(name: string): Promise<ServiceFacade<T>> {
    if (!this.services.has(name)) {
      const factory = this.factories.get(name)
      if (!factory) throw new Error(`Service not registered: ${name}`)
      
      const facade = new BaseServiceFacade(name, factory, defaultConfig)
      await facade.initialize()
      this.services.set(name, facade)
    }
    
    return this.services.get(name)!
  }
}
```

```typescript
class ServiceCoordinator {
  constructor(private registry: ServiceRegistry) {}
  
  async batch<T>(operations: ServiceOperation[]): Promise<T[]> {
    const results = await Promise.allSettled(
      operations.map(op => this.executeOperation(op))
    )
    
    return results.map(result => {
      if (result.status === 'rejected') {
        throw new ServiceOperationError(result.reason)
      }
      return result.value
    })
  }
  
  async transaction<T>(operations: ServiceOperation[]): Promise<T> {
    const rollbacks: (() => Promise<void>)[] = []
    
    try {
      const results = []
      for (const operation of operations) {
        const result = await this.executeOperation(operation)
        results.push(result)
        
        if (operation.rollback) {
          rollbacks.push(operation.rollback)
        }
      }
      return results as T
    } catch (error) {
      // Execute rollbacks in reverse order
      for (const rollback of rollbacks.reverse()) {
        try {
          await rollback()
        } catch (rollbackError) {
          console.error('Rollback failed:', rollbackError)
        }
      }
      throw error
    }
  }
}
```
