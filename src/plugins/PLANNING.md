# Plugins Module Planning

## üéØ Current Focus

### Active Development
- Plugin lifecycle management and dependency resolution
- Event-driven communication between plugins
- Plugin registry and discovery system
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection

### This Week's Goals
- Stabilize plugin lifecycle state transitions
- Implement plugin event communication system
- Add plugin configuration validation
- Create plugin development documentation

## üóìÔ∏è Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Plugin System
- [x] Basic plugin registration and lifecycle
- [ ] Dependency resolution and ordering
- [ ] Event communication between plugins
- [ ] Plugin configuration and validation
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### Phase 2: Plugin Ecosystem
- [ ] Plugin marketplace and discovery
- [ ] Plugin versioning and compatibility
- [ ] Plugin sandboxing and security
- [ ] Hot plugin reloading
- [ ] Plugin development tools

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Plugin composition and inheritance
- [ ] Cross-platform plugin distribution
- [ ] Plugin analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Visual plugin management UI
- [ ] Plugin testing framework

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Plugin Lifecycle
- **Decision**: Explicit state machine with cleanup guarantees
- **Rationale**: Predictable behavior and resource management
- **Impact**: More complex but much more reliable

### Event System
- **Decision**: Typed event communication with Effect integration
- **Rationale**: Type-safe inter-plugin communication
- **Impact**: Better developer experience but requires Effect knowledge

### Plugin Loading
- **Decision**: Dynamic module loading with caching
- **Rationale**: Supports both static and dynamic plugin discovery
- **Impact**: Complex resolution but flexible deployment

## üîÑ Refactoring Plans

### Plugin Manager Simplification
- Reduce API surface for common plugin operations
- Add fluent interface for plugin configuration
- Implement plugin builder pattern
- Add plugin templates and scaffolding

### Event System Enhancement
- Add event serialization for cross-process plugins
- Implement event replay and debugging
- Add event filtering and routing
- Create event schema validation

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals
- Unit Tests: 85%
- Integration Tests: 80%
- Plugin E2E Tests: 75%

### Missing Tests
- Plugin dependency edge cases
- Event communication reliability
- Plugin error recovery scenarios
- Performance under plugin load

## üìö Documentation Needs

### High Priority
- Plugin development guide with examples
- Plugin architecture overview
- Event communication patterns
- Plugin lifecycle documentation

## üí° Ideas & Research

### Plugin Ecosystem
- WebAssembly plugins for cross-language support
- Remote plugin execution and coordination
- Plugin composition and inheritance patterns
- Visual plugin development environment
