 * Tabs Component - Multi-view interface with tab navigation

 * TODO: This component needs to be migrated from TEA architecture to JSX/MVU
 * The TEA-style UIComponent interface doesn't exist in our MVU system.
 * This should be rewritten as a JSX component using runes for state management.
 * 
 * Original functionality:
 * - Multiple tab views with content switching
 * - Keyboard navigation between tabs
 * - Customizable styling and layout
 * - Support for dynamic tab content
 * - Tab state management
