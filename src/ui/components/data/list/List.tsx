 * List Component - Vertical scrollable list with selection

 * TODO: This component needs to be migrated from TEA architecture to JSX/MVU
 * The TEA-style UIComponent interface doesn't exist in our MVU system.
 * This should be rewritten as a JSX component using runes for state management.
 * 
 * Original functionality:
 * - Vertical scrolling with keyboard navigation
 * - Single/multi selection support
 * - Custom item rendering
 * - Filtering and search
 * - Virtualization for large lists
 * - Focus management
 * - Customizable key bindings
