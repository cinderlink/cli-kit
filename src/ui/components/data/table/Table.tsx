 * Table Component - Tabular data display with advanced features

 * TODO: This component needs to be migrated from TEA architecture to JSX/MVU
 * The TEA-style UIComponent interface doesn't exist in our MVU system.
 * This should be rewritten as a JSX component using runes for state management.
 * 
 * Original functionality:
 * - Dynamic column configuration
 * - Row selection (single/multi)
 * - Sorting and filtering
 * - Pagination support
 * - Keyboard navigation
 * - Custom cell rendering
 * - Responsive column widths
