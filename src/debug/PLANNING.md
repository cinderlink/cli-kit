# Debug Module Planning

## Current State

The debug module provides an interactive debugging interface for Tuix applications with automatic activation via `TUIX_DEBUG=true`.

## Future Enhancements

### Short Term
- [ ] Add network request tracking tab
- [ ] Implement state snapshot/restore functionality
- [ ] Add debug command palette (Cmd+K style)
- [ ] Create debug API for third-party plugins

### Medium Term
- [ ] Time-travel debugging for state changes
- [ ] Export/import debug sessions
- [ ] Remote debugging support
- [ ] Performance profiling with flame graphs

### Long Term
- [ ] Visual component tree explorer
- [ ] Integrated test runner in debug mode
- [ ] Debug replay from production logs
- [ ] AI-powered debug assistance

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Optimize event storage for long-running sessions
- [ ] Add configurable event retention policies
- [ ] Improve render tree tracking accuracy
- [ ] Add unit tests for debug components

## API Stability
The debug module API is currently experimental. Breaking changes may occur in minor versions until 1.0.0.
