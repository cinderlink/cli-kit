# Code Review Process

## Overview

This is the comprehensive code review methodology for ensuring code quality, architectural consistency, and knowledge sharing across the TUIX framework development.

## Core Code Review Principles

### 1. Standards Compliance First
**Principle**: Every code change must comply with established standards before functionality review.

**Standards to Check**:
- [Single Implementation Principle](../rules/single-implementation.md)
- [Type Safety Rules](../rules/type-safety.md)
- [Testing Requirements](../rules/testing.md)
- [Effect.ts Patterns](../dependencies/effect/rules.md)
- [Bun API Usage](../dependencies/bun/rules.md)

### 2. Architecture Alignment
**Principle**: Code changes must align with overall system architecture and design patterns.

**Architectural Concerns**:
- Module boundaries and dependencies
- Event-driven communication patterns
- Scope system integration
- Effect composition patterns
- Component lifecycle management

### 3. Quality Gates
**Principle**: All code must pass automated and manual quality checks.

**Required Validations**:
- All tests pass (`bun test`)
- No TypeScript errors (`bun run tsc --noEmit`)
- Code coverage thresholds met
- Documentation requirements fulfilled

#### Review Comment Guidelines

**Constructive Feedback Format**:
```markdown
## Issue: [Category - Standards/Architecture/Quality/Documentation]
**Problem**: [Specific issue description]
**Impact**: [Why this matters]
**Suggestion**: [Recommended solution]
**Reference**: [Link to relevant standards/docs]
```

**Example Comments**:
```markdown
## Issue: Standards - Type Safety
**Problem**: Line 45 uses `any` type for user data
**Impact**: Loses type safety for external API responses
**Suggestion**: Use type guard function to validate user data
**Reference**: [Type Safety Rules](../rules/type-safety.md#type-guards)

## Issue: Architecture - Module Dependencies  
**Problem**: Direct import of JSX-specific code in core module
**Impact**: Creates tight coupling between domains
**Suggestion**: Use event-driven communication via EventBus
**Reference**: [Refactor Orchestration](../orchestration/refactor-orchestration.md#event-driven-communication)
```
