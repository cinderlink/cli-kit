# Audit Finding: src/core/runtime.ts & runtime.test.ts

## File: src/core/runtime.ts

### Purpose
Application runtime system - the heart of TUIX framework implementing MVU loop with Effect fibers

### Current Status
- **Documented**: Yes - Excellent JSDoc with comprehensive examples
- **Tested**: Partially - Has `src/core/runtime.test.ts` but limited coverage
- **Used By**: All applications (runtime engine)
- **Dependencies**: Effect, services, errors, types

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Type Safety**: Good - Proper TypeScript usage
- **Error Handling**: Good - Comprehensive error handling with cleanup
- **Effect Usage**: Excellent - Advanced fiber management and concurrency
- **API Design**: Good - Clean runtime API, but could be simpler

### Documentation Assessment
- **Completeness**: Excellent - All functions well documented
- **Accuracy**: Excellent - Documentation matches implementation
- **Examples**: Good - Usage examples provided
- **Links**: Good - Proper cross-references

### Test Assessment
- **Coverage**: Limited - Only tests configuration and basic component integration
- **Quality**: Fair - Missing tests for core runtime behavior
- **Types**: Unit tests only, no integration tests
- **Performance**: Good - Tests run quickly

### Issues Found
- [x] **Issue 1**: Test coverage insufficient for critical runtime functionality
- [ ] **Issue 2**: Complex fiber management might be hard for users to debug
- [ ] **Issue 3**: Mouse routing implementation seems incomplete (logs but doesn't route properly)
- [ ] **Issue 4**: Signal handler cleanup might leak event listeners

### Recommendations
- [x] **Recommendation 1**: Add comprehensive runtime tests (render loop, subscriptions, cleanup)
- [ ] **Recommendation 2**: Simplify API or provide helper functions
- [ ] **Recommendation 3**: Complete mouse routing implementation
- [ ] **Recommendation 4**: Add runtime debugging/inspection tools

### Standards Compliance
- [x] **CODE_STANDARDS.md**: Compliant - Good Effect usage
- [x] **DOC_STANDARDS.md**: Compliant - Well documented
- [x] **Single Implementation**: Compliant - No duplicates
- [x] **JSX Preference**: N/A - Core runtime

### Action Items
- [x] **High Priority**: Expand test coverage for runtime behavior
- [ ] **High Priority**: Fix mouse routing to properly deliver events
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Add runtime debugging capabilities
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Simplify API surface

### Final Status
**Decision**: Keep
**Reason**: Core runtime is well-designed but needs better test coverage and mouse routing fixes. Critical component.
