# Audit Finding: src/cli/router.ts

## File: src/cli/router.ts

### Purpose
CLI command router that routes parsed commands to their handlers with support for lazy loading, middleware, and command suggestions.

### Current Status
- **Documented**: Good - Most methods have basic JSDoc
- **Tested**: No - Missing `src/cli/router.test.ts`
- **Used By**: CLI framework for command routing and execution
- **Dependencies**: cli/types

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Type Safety**: Good - Proper TypeScript usage throughout
- **Error Handling**: Fair - Basic error enhancement but no Effect integration
- **Effect Usage**: None - Traditional Promise-based approach
- **API Design**: Good - Comprehensive routing with lazy loading and middleware

### Documentation Assessment
- **Completeness**: Fair - Most methods have basic docs but missing details
- **Accuracy**: Good - Documentation matches implementation
- **Examples**: Poor - No usage examples provided
- **Links**: Poor - No references to related modules

### Test Assessment
- **Coverage**: 0% - No test file exists
- **Quality**: N/A
- **Types**: Good - Well-typed interfaces and return types
- **Performance**: Good - Efficient command resolution and caching

### Issues Found
- [x] **Issue 1**: Missing test file
- [ ] **Issue 2**: No Effect integration for async operations
- [ ] **Issue 3**: Lazy handler detection is basic (line 143) - relies on function.length
- [ ] **Issue 4**: Error enhancement is minimal (line 166)
- [ ] **Issue 5**: CommandSuggestions class could be more sophisticated
- [ ] **Issue 6**: Middleware application order could be confusing (line 267)

### Recommendations
- [x] **Recommendation 1**: Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] **Recommendation 2**: Add Effect integration for consistency
- [ ] **Recommendation 3**: Improve lazy handler detection mechanism
- [ ] **Recommendation 4**: Enhanced error handling with proper context
- [ ] **Recommendation 5**: Add usage examples and better documentation
- [ ] **Recommendation 6**: Consider fuzzy matching for command suggestions

### Standards Compliance
- [x] **CODE_STANDARDS.md**: Good - No any types, proper TypeScript
- [x] **DOC_STANDARDS.md**: Partial - Basic documentation but missing examples
- [x] **Single Implementation**: Compliant - Single router system
- [ ] **Effect Usage**: Non-compliant - Should use Effect for async operations

### Action Items
- [x] **High Priority**: Create comprehensive test file
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Add Effect integration
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Improve error handling
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Enhanced command suggestions
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Add usage examples

### Final Status
**Decision**: Keep - Good Design
**Reason**: Well-designed command router with good separation of concerns. Handles lazy loading, middleware, and command suggestions effectively. Only needs tests and Effect integration to meet framework standards. The Levenshtein distance implementation for suggestions is particularly well done.
