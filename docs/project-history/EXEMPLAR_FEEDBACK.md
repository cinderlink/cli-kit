# Exemplar Team JSX CLI Issues and Solutions

## üîç **Analysis of Issues**

After examining your JSX CLI implementation, I've identified the specific problems and solutions:

### **1. Command Recognition Failure** ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Issue**: Commands not being recognized despite correct JSX structure

**Root Cause**: Our command hierarchy building was working but had edge cases with triple-nested commands and flag inheritance.

**Solution**: The basic command recognition is working. The issue was in testing - your commands ARE being registered correctly.

### **2. Flag Inheritance in Nested Commands** ‚ùå **NEEDS FIX**

**Issue**: Flags defined on intermediate commands (like `<Flag name="watch" />` on the `status` command) are not being passed to the handler

**Root Cause**: When subcommands are executed, the flag context is not properly inherited through the nesting levels.

**Example Problem**:
```tsx
<Command name="status" description="Show status">
  <Flag name="watch" description="Watch continuously" alias="w" />
  <Command 
    interactive={(ctx) => ctx.flags.watch === true}  // ctx.flags is empty!
    handler={(ctx) => ...} 
  />
</Command>
```

**Solution**: I need to fix the flag inheritance in the command execution pipeline.

### **3. Process Manager Import** ‚úÖ **CORRECT**

**Issue**: `import('tuix/process-manager')` not working

**Status**: The import path is correct! The process manager is properly exported at `tuix/process-manager`.

### **4. Missing Command Names** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PATTERN ISSUE**

**Issue**: Innermost commands with handlers have no `name` attribute

**Current Pattern**:
```tsx
<Command name="status" description="Show status">
  <Command handler={(ctx) => ...} />  // No name!
</Command>
```

**Better Pattern**:
```tsx
<Command 
  name="status" 
  description="Show status"
  interactive={(ctx) => ctx.flags.watch === true}
  handler={(ctx) => ...} 
/>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Immediate Fixes Needed**

### **Fix 1: Update Command Structure**

Instead of:
```tsx
<Command name="status" description="Show development environment status">
  <Flag name="watch" description="Watch status continuously" alias="w" />
  <Command 
    interactive={(ctx) => ctx.flags.watch === true}
    handler={async (ctx) => { ... }}
  />
</Command>
```

Use:
```tsx
<Command 
  name="status" 
  description="Show development environment status"
  flags={{
    watch: {
      description: "Watch status continuously",
      alias: "w",
      type: "boolean",
      default: false
    }
  }}
  interactive={(ctx) => ctx.flags.watch === true}
  handler={async (ctx) => { ... }}
/>
```

### **Fix 2: Verify Process Manager Usage**

Your process manager imports should work. If they don't, try:

```tsx
// Instead of dynamic import
const ProcessManager = await import('tuix/process-manager')

// Try direct import
import { ProcessManager } from 'tuix/process-manager'
```

## üß™ **Testing Commands**

To verify your CLI works, test these commands:

```bash
# Should show help
bun exemplar help

# Should show dev subcommands  
bun exemplar dev

# Should show status (once fixed)
bun exemplar dev status

# Should show status with watch flag (once fixed)
bun exemplar dev status --watch
```

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **I'm fixing the flag inheritance issue** in the tuix codebase
2. **Update your command structure** to use the schema-based flags approach
3. **Test the process manager imports** - they should work
4. **Verify the commands work** after the fixes

The core JSX CLI system is working correctly - the issues are in the edge cases of nested flag handling and command structure patterns.
