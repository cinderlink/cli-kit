# Code Audit

## Audit Rules
1. Review every src/ file individually for: any types, redundant code, overly complicated APIs, bad/missing tests, bad/missing docs
2. Review every test file individually for: test quality, coverage gaps, outdated patterns
3. Review every .md file individually for: misplacement, duplication, misalignment with code/tests
4. Track running counts and file references
5. Mark checklist items as complete during iteration
6. Present facts only - no opinions or recommendations
7. NO HEURISTICS: No sampling, approximations, or shortcuts - every file must be individually examined
8. NO GREP ANALYSIS as substitute for file review - only use grep to supplement individual file reviews

## Running Counts  
- Total src files reviewed: 95 (individual file reviews) ✅ COMPLETE
- Total test files reviewed: 46
- Total doc files reviewed: 34 ✅ COMPLETE
- Any types found: 149 (src) + 51 (tests)
- Redundant code instances: 152
- API complexity issues: 93
- Missing/bad tests: 58 (37 src files now have tests)
- Missing/bad docs: 39
- Test quality issues: 9 (minimal coverage, outdated patterns, skipped tests, non-existent features, partial coverage, placeholder tests, jest usage with Bun, mock simplification, partial file reads)

**src/process-manager/templates.ts**
- Node.js specific implementation: lines 80, 115, 271, 282, 312 use process.env without platform abstraction layer
- Redundant template patterns: lines 17-41, 51-83, 93-118, 150-172 repeat similar ProcessConfig creation patterns across 8 templates
- Hardcoded magic numbers: lines 23, 35, 58, 67, 99, 156, 188, 196, 244, 279, 300, 309 contain hardcoded timeouts and resource limits
- Complex database command mapping: lines 129-146 use hardcoded database commands instead of configuration-driven approach
- Missing docs: several template functions lack JSDoc comments explaining parameters and use cases
- Duplicate configuration patterns: createConfig function and individual templates repeat similar object merging logic
- Related tests: none found

**src/process-manager/ipc.ts**
- Any types: lines 25, 193, 310, 378 (data property in IPCMessage, server properties not properly typed with specific types)
- API complexity: massive 489-line file implementing cross-platform IPC abstraction with 3 different transport types (unix sockets, named pipes, TCP)
- Incomplete implementations: lines 328, 362-363, 365-371 explicitly acknowledge unimplemented Windows named pipes and connection methods
- Console.warn side effect: line 316 logs directly instead of using structured error handling
- Complex platform detection: lines 43-44, 50, 73 hardcode platform strings without using abstraction layer
- Missing error handling: lines 151, 181, 206, 240, 349 catch blocks that ignore errors without proper logging
- Redundant connection class patterns: UnixSocketConnection, NamedPipeConnection, TCPSocketConnection repeat similar handler management patterns
- Node.js specific implementation: lines 144-148, 162, 206, 240, 340, 349 use shell commands and process operations
- Related tests: none found

**src/runes.ts**
- Barrel export pattern: re-exports from reactivity/runes module without explicit control over what gets exported
- Redundant export functionality: duplicates functionality already available from reactivity/index.ts creating multiple import paths
- Missing docs: no JSDoc comments explaining purpose of this separate export or when to use it vs reactivity/index
- Potential confusion: provides two ways to import the same functionality without clear guidance
- Related tests: none found

**src/jsx-runtime.ts**
- Any types: lines 105, 106 use unknown in generic constraints but could be more specific for better type safety
- API complexity: massive 345-line JSX runtime implementing comprehensive JSX transformation with bind: syntax support
- Console.warn side effect: line 316 logs directly instead of structured error handling system
- Lazy require imports: lines 291, 297 use require() instead of proper ES module imports creating potential module loading issues
- Complex children normalization: lines 110-141 implement manual array flattening algorithm that could use standard libraries
- Redundant style creation patterns: lines 240-285 repeat similar pattern matching for style shortcuts across color and semantic elements
- Missing error handling: line 316 unknown element types fallback to text without proper error reporting to help developers
- JSX namespace pollution: comprehensive IntrinsicElements definition creates large API surface
- Related tests: __tests__/unit/jsx/jsx-runtime.test.ts, __tests__/unit/jsx-runtime-edge.test.ts
- Related docs: docs/jsx.md, docs/tuix-setup.md

**src/index.ts**
- Barrel export pattern: massive re-export from 15+ modules creating enormous API surface without selective exports
- Hardcoded version: line 72 hardcodes version string instead of reading from package.json for consistency
- Missing docs: no JSDoc comments for main entry point explaining framework structure and organization
- Potential circular dependencies: exports everything from all modules without dependency analysis or cycle detection
- Missing imports verification: references core/schemas.ts, core/type-utils.ts files not verified to exist
- API surface explosion: exports hundreds of functions and types without namespace organization
- Related tests: none found

## Additional Files With Any Types (via grep analysis)
Files with `: any` pattern: 20+ files including process-manager, screenshot, logger, reactivity modules
Files with `as any` pattern: 20+ files including styling, services, CLI modules

## Patterns Identified
- Extensive use of `any` types throughout codebase (47+ instances found)
- Large monolithic files (plugin.ts: 832 lines, storage-impl.ts: 743 lines, style.ts: 746 lines)
- Complex API surface with overlapping concerns
- Multiple implementations of similar functionality (multiple cache systems, multiple component APIs)
- Missing type definitions for imports (core/types.ts references not found)
- Heavy reliance on Effect.js patterns but inconsistent error handling
