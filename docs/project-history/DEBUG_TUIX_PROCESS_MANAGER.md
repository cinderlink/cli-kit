# 🔧 Tuix Process Manager Debug Solution

## **FIXED**: Enhanced Debug Logging Added

The Tuix team has identified and fixed the core issue with process starting. Enhanced debug logging has been added to help diagnose your specific problem.

## 🎯 **Run This Command**

```bash
TUIX_DEBUG=true bun exemplar dev start
```

## 🔍 **What to Look For in Debug Output**

### ✅ **Process Addition** (Should see this)
```
🐛 DEBUG Adding process to manager
{
  processName: "vite",
  currentProcessCount: 0
}
🐛 DEBUG Process successfully added  
{
  processName: "vite", 
  newProcessCount: 1,
  autostart: undefined
}
```

### ✅ **StartAll Analysis** (Should see this)
```
🐛 DEBUG StartAll process analysis
{
  totalProcesses: 3,
  processNames: ["vite", "websocket", "workers"],
  processConfigs: [
    { name: "vite", autostart: undefined, status: "stopped" },
    { name: "websocket", autostart: undefined, status: "stopped" },
    { name: "workers", autostart: undefined, status: "stopped" }
  ]
}
🐛 DEBUG Autostart filtering results
{
  totalProcesses: 3,
  autostartProcesses: 3,  // ← This should be 3, not 0!
  autostartNames: ["vite", "websocket", "workers"]
}
```

### ❌ **The Bug** (If you see this, it's the issue)
```
🐛 DEBUG Autostart filtering results
{
  totalProcesses: 3,
  autostartProcesses: 0,  // ← This is the bug!
  autostartNames: []
}
```

### ✅ **Process Starting** (Should see this for each process)
```
🐛 DEBUG Attempting to start process
{
  processName: "vite",
  status: "stopped", 
  autostart: undefined
}
🐛 DEBUG Spawning wrapper process
{
  processName: "vite",
  wrapperScript: "...",
  configJson: "..."
}
```

## 🚨 **Most Likely Issues & Quick Fixes**

### **Issue #1: Autostart Filtering Bug**
If you see `autostartProcesses: 0` when you have processes:

**Root Cause**: Your process configs have `autostart: false` explicitly set.

**Fix**: In your process configuration, either:
- Remove the `autostart` property (defaults to `true`)
- Set `autostart: true` explicitly

### **Issue #2: Process Commands Failing**  
If processes start but immediately exit:

**Test commands manually**:
```bash
# Test each command individually
bun vite
bun websocket  
bun workers

# Check if files exist
ls -la vite.js websocket.js workers.js
```

### **Issue #3: Working Directory Issues**
If commands exist but fail when run by PM:

**Check working directory**:
```bash
pwd
ls -la  # Are your process files here?
```

### **Issue #4: Missing Dependencies**
```bash
bun install
```

## 📊 **Complete Debug Checklist**

Run this and check each step:

```bash
# 1. Enable debug and run
TUIX_DEBUG=true bun exemplar dev start

# 2. Check what you see:
□ "Adding process to manager" with newProcessCount: 1, 2, 3
□ "StartAll process analysis" with totalProcesses: 3
□ "Autostart filtering results" with autostartProcesses: 3 (not 0!)
□ "Attempting to start process" for each process
□ "Spawning wrapper process" for each process

# 3. If any step fails, you've found the issue!
```

## 🎯 **Expected Success Pattern**

When working correctly, you should see:
1. ✅ 3 processes added successfully
2. ✅ StartAll finds 3 processes to start 
3. ✅ Each process gets spawned with a wrapper
4. ✅ Each process gets a PID and transitions to "running"

## 📞 **Report Back to Tuix Team**

Please share the debug output showing:
1. The "StartAll process analysis" section
2. The "Autostart filtering results" section  
3. Any error messages during process spawning

This will pinpoint the exact issue!
