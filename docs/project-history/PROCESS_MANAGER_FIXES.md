# 🔧 Process Manager Critical Fixes for Exemplar Team

## ✅ Three Major Issues Fixed

### 1. **Command Validation** ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Problem**: Processes failing because commands don't exist or aren't executable in the tuix environment.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive command validation before process startup:
- Validates command existence with `--version` or `--help` 
- For `bun` commands, checks target file exists
- Provides detailed error messages for debugging

**Debug Output**: Look for `"Validating process command"` in debug logs.

---

### 2. **IPC Ping Timeouts** ⚠️ CRITICAL  
**Problem**: Aggressive 10-second timeouts causing processes to be marked as orphaned immediately.

**Fixes**:
- **Ping timeout**: Extended from 10s → 30s for startup stability
- **IPC wait timeout**: Extended from 10s → 30s for wrapper initialization  
- **Check interval**: Reduced from 100ms → 200ms to be less aggressive

**Debug Output**: Look for `"Command timeout"` messages - should now be much less frequent.

---

### 3. **Health Check Startup Interference** ⚠️ MODERATE
**Problem**: Health checks starting immediately and interfering with process startup.

**Fix**: Added 10-second startup delay before first health check:
- Processes now have time to fully initialize before health monitoring begins
- Prevents false negatives during startup phase

**Debug Output**: Health check logs should appear 10+ seconds after process start.

## 🎯 **Test Command for Exemplar Team**

```bash
TUIX_DEBUG=true bun exemplar dev start
```

## 🔍 **What You Should See Now**

### ✅ **Successful Process Validation**
```
🐛 DEBUG Validating process command
{
  processName: "vite",
  command: "bun", 
  args: ["vite.js"],
  cwd: "/path/to/project"
}
🐛 DEBUG Bun target file exists
{
  processName: "vite",
  targetFile: "vite.js", 
  fullPath: "/path/to/project/vite.js"
}
🐛 DEBUG Command validation successful
```

### ✅ **Extended IPC Timeouts**  
```
🐛 DEBUG Waiting for IPC endpoint to be ready (30s timeout)
🐛 DEBUG Sending ping to verify responsiveness (30s timeout)
```

### ✅ **Delayed Health Checks**
```
[10 seconds after process start]
🐛 DEBUG Starting health monitoring with 10s startup delay
```

## 🚨 **If Processes Still Fail**

The most likely remaining issues:

1. **Command Path Issues**: Your process commands might need full paths
2. **Working Directory**: Processes might be running in wrong directory  
3. **Environment Variables**: Missing required environment variables
4. **Dependencies**: Missing `node_modules` or similar dependencies

**Next Debug Steps**:
1. Try running your commands manually: `bun vite.js`, `bun websocket.js`, etc.
2. Check if files exist: `ls -la *.js` in your project directory
3. Verify working directory in process config: `"cwd": "/full/path/to/project"`

## 📊 **Expected Success Pattern**

1. ✅ Command validation passes for all processes
2. ✅ IPC connections establish within 30 seconds  
3. ✅ Processes start and stay running (not marked as orphaned immediately)
4. ✅ Health checks begin after 10-second startup delay
5. ✅ CLI detaches properly and exits

These fixes should resolve the three core issues preventing your processes from running successfully!
