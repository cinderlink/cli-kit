# Documentation Alignment Initiative - Process Tracking

## Process Overview

**Process Type**: documentation-alignment  
**Process ID**: 2025-01-18-docs-alignment-initiative  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Started**: 2025-01-18  
**Lead**: Claude  
**Requested by**: Drew  

## Objective

Create a comprehensive documentation alignment system in `docs/alignment/` that provides:

1. **Granular, well-organized documentation** in the form of rules, development guides, orchestration processes, checklists, and templates
2. **Single source of truth** (`docs/alignment/README.md`) for team members and AI assistants
3. **Clear structure** for dependency-specific documentation
4. **Clean separation** between alignment docs, tracking docs, and framework docs
5. **Process tracking system** to keep docs folders organized

## Scope

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [x] Create `docs/alignment/` and `docs/tracking/` directories
- [x] Research existing process documentation across codebase
- [x] Analyze current code standards and rules 
- [x] Create process tracking documentation for this initiative
- [ ] Design `docs/alignment/` structure
- [ ] Create `docs/alignment/README.md` master guide
- [ ] Create dependency documentation structure

### Phase 2: Content Migration and Organization
- [ ] Migrate relevant standards from existing docs to alignment structure
- [ ] Create granular rule documents for specific domains
- [ ] Develop process orchestration guides  
- [ ] Create checklists and templates
- [ ] Establish AI assistant instruction system

### Phase 3: Cleanup and Integration
- [ ] Clean up existing docs directory structure
- [ ] Move non-framework docs to appropriate locations
- [ ] Update all internal doc references
- [ ] Validate all links and cross-references
- [ ] Final review and testing

## Key Findings from Research

### Existing Process Documents Found

**Standards and Rules:**
- `docs/NAMING_AND_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` - Core architectural principles
- `docs/audit/AUDIT_RULES.md` - Audit process and project vision
- `docs/audit/standards/CODE_STANDARDS.md` - Comprehensive code quality rules
- `docs/audit/standards/DOC_STANDARDS.md` - Documentation standards
- `docs/sandbox/rules.md` - Scope system refactor rules
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant instructions and tool preferences

**Process Documentation:**
- `docs/LIFECYCLE.md` - Component lifecycle patterns  
- `docs/audit/` directory - Comprehensive audit system with findings, opinions, solutions
- `docs/sandbox/phases/` - Phase-based development planning
- `docs/project-history/` - Historical process tracking and decisions

**Framework Documentation:**
- `docs/core/`, `docs/jsx-guide.md`, `docs/jsx-cli-guide.md` - Framework-specific docs
- `docs/config.md`, `docs/logger.md`, `docs/process-manager.md` - Feature docs
- Various component and service documentation

### Key Principles Identified

1. **Single Implementation Principle** - Critical rule against duplicate implementations
2. **Effect.ts Integration** - All async operations must use Effect patterns  
3. **Bun-First Approach** - Use Bun APIs over Node.js alternatives
4. **Component Logic Testing** - Preferred testing strategy
5. **JSDoc Requirements** - All exported APIs must be documented
6. **Type Safety** - No `any` types, proper discriminated unions
7. **Process Tracking** - Round-based audits with strict validation

## Success Criteria

### Primary Goals
- [ ] Single `docs/alignment/README.md` serves as complete team guidance
- [ ] Clear AI assistant rules and workflow instructions  
- [ ] Dependency-specific documentation is well-organized
- [ ] Process tracking keeps docs folders clean
- [ ] All existing valuable documentation is preserved and organized

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All links in alignment docs are functional
- [ ] No duplicate information across alignment docs
- [ ] Clear navigation paths for all use cases
- [ ] Consistent formatting and structure
- [ ] Comprehensive coverage of all development scenarios

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Updates to `CLAUDE.md` reference alignment system
- [ ] All existing doc references updated to new structure
- [ ] Framework docs clearly separated from process docs
- [ ] Tracking system is documented and easy to follow

## Next Steps

1. **Complete foundation setup** - Finish remaining Phase 1 tasks
2. **Design alignment structure** - Create detailed directory layout
3. **Create master README** - Single source of truth document
4. **Begin content migration** - Move and organize existing standards
5. **Validate and test** - Ensure all links and processes work

## Notes

- This initiative follows the existing audit and standards patterns already established
- Focus on granular, actionable documentation rather than high-level concepts
- Maintain consistency with existing Effect.ts and Bun preferences
- Ensure AI assistants have clear, specific instructions for different scenarios
- Keep framework documentation separate from process/alignment documentation
