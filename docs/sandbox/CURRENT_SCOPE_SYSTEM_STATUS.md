# Current Scope System Implementation Status

## Overview

TUIX has a fully implemented scope system that successfully fixes plugin nesting issues. The core infrastructure has been completed and is now fully integrated with the JSX component system.

## What Currently Exists

### 1. Core Scope System (`src/core/scope.ts`)

```typescript
export interface ScopeContext {
  id: string
  type: 'plugin' | 'command' | 'component' 
  name: string
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
  // Parent-child relationships managed by ScopeStack
}

export class ScopeStack {
  push(scope: ScopeContext): Effect<void, ScopeError>
  pop(): Effect<ScopeContext | null, never>
  current(): ScopeContext | null
  findById(id: string): ScopeContext | null
  getHierarchy(): ScopeContext[]
  // ... other methods
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Stack-based scope management
- ✅ Parent-child relationship tracking
- ✅ Path computation from root
- ✅ Scope registry with lookup
- ✅ Effect-based operations

### 2. JSX Scope Integration (`src/core/jsx-scope-integration.ts`)

```typescript
export class JSXScopeIntegration {
  processPluginElement(element: JSX.Element): Effect<void, JSXError>
  processCommandElement(element: JSX.Element): Effect<void, JSXError>
  processComponentElement(element: JSX.Element): Effect<void, JSXError>
  // ... other methods
}
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Processes Plugin/Command JSX elements
- ✅ Maintains scope hierarchy during rendering
- ✅ Registers commands with full path context
- ✅ Integrates with JSXPluginRegistry

### 3. Updated JSX Runtime (`src/jsx/runtime.ts`)

The JSXPluginRegistry now uses the unified scope stack:

```typescript
class JSXPluginRegistry {
  private scopeStack: ScopeStack = new ScopeStack()
  private scopeIntegration: JSXScopeIntegration
  
  startPlugin(name: string): void {
    // Creates plugin scope and pushes to unified stack
  }
  
  finalizePlugin(): void {
    // Pops from unified scope stack
  }
}
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Removed old `currentPluginName` string approach
- ✅ Uses unified scope stack
- ✅ Fixed disconnected stack issues

## What Was Completed (Phase 1)

### 1. CLI Component Integration ✅

CLI components now fully use the scope system:

```typescript
// Implemented in src/cli/components/Plugin.tsx
export function Plugin({ name, description, children }: PluginProps) {
  const scope = useScope({
    type: 'plugin',
    name,
    metadata: { description }
  })
  
  // Full scope lifecycle management implemented
}

// Implemented in src/cli/components/Command.tsx  
export function Command({ name, handler, children }: CommandProps) {
  const scope = useScope({
    type: 'command',
    name,
    metadata: { handler }
  })
  
  // Automatic path registration implemented
}
```

### 2. Scope System Documentation ✅

The two scope systems have been documented and their purposes clarified:
- `src/core/scope.ts` - Runtime scope management
- `src/jsx/scope.ts` - UI rendering helpers
- See `docs/SCOPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full explanation

### 3. Automatic Command Registration ✅

Commands are now automatically registered with their full hierarchical path derived from the JSX structure.

## How Plugin Nesting Currently Works

1. **JSX Structure Creates Hierarchy:**
   ```tsx
   <Plugin name="pm">
     <Command name="start" />
     <Plugin name="logs">
       <Command name="show" />
     </Plugin>
   </Plugin>
   ```

2. **Scope Stack Maintains Relationships:**
   - When "pm" plugin starts → push plugin scope
   - When "start" command processes → push command scope, register with path ["pm", "start"]
   - When "logs" plugin starts → push plugin scope (parent is "pm")
   - When "show" command processes → push command scope, register with path ["pm", "logs", "show"]

3. **Command Registration:**
   - Commands are registered with their full path
   - Router can find commands by path traversal

## Previously Known Issues (Now Resolved)

1. ✅ **Example Gap**: Created `examples/nested-plugins-demo.tsx` demonstrating plugin nesting
2. ✅ **Two Scope Systems**: Documented in `docs/SCOPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - kept separate by design
3. ✅ **Incomplete Integration**: CLI components now fully integrated with scope wrapping

## Completed Items

1. ✅ **CLI Component Integration**: Plugin and Command components now use scope system
2. ✅ **Scope Documentation**: Relationship between two systems clarified and documented
3. ✅ **Nesting Example**: Working example with deep nesting and command hierarchy
4. ✅ **Test Integration**: Comprehensive tests in `tests/e2e/plugin-nesting-complete.test.ts`

## Testing

Comprehensive tests exist in `tests/e2e/plugin-nesting.test.ts` that verify:
- Nested plugin hierarchies work correctly
- Sibling plugins maintain separate scopes  
- Commands are properly scoped to their parent plugin
- The "exemplar scoping bug" (auth commands leaking into dev scope) is addressed

## Summary

The scope system implementation is now complete. The core infrastructure has been successfully integrated with CLI components, enabling proper plugin nesting in JSX applications. The JSX runtime uses a unified scope stack, and all components properly participate in the scope hierarchy.

### Phase 1 Completion
✅ All Phase 1 objectives have been achieved:
1. CLI components integrated with scope system
2. Working nested plugin example created
3. Two scope implementations documented (kept separate by design)
4. Comprehensive integration tests added

### Key Implementation Files
- `src/core/scope-hooks.ts` - React-style hooks for scope management
- `src/cli/components/Plugin.tsx` - Scope-aware Plugin component
- `src/cli/components/Command.tsx` - Updated Command with scope integration
- `examples/nested-plugins-demo.tsx` - Working demonstration
- `tests/e2e/plugin-nesting-complete.test.ts` - Integration tests

### Documentation
- `docs/SCOPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture explanation
- `docs/SCOPE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Usage guide for developers

### Future Considerations
The event-driven architecture described in phases 2-7 remains a proposal. Based on the successful implementation of the scope system with direct imports, the current architecture may be sufficient for TUIX's needs.
