# Phase Documentation Audit Report

## Executive Summary

The phase documentation in `docs/sandbox/phases/` describes an aspirational event-driven architecture that **does not currently exist** in the TUIX codebase. The documents appear to be a design proposal for a major architectural transformation rather than documentation of existing functionality.

**UPDATE**: Phase 1 has been successfully completed. The remaining phases (2-7) remain proposals.

## Key Findings

### 1. Phase 1 Plugin Nesting Fix - **✅ COMPLETED**

**Documentation Claims:**
- JSXPluginRegistry uses single `currentPluginName` causing nesting failures
- Context stack and command stack are disconnected
- CLI components need scope integration

**Completion Status:**
- ✅ JSXPluginRegistry refactored to use unified `ScopeStack`
- ✅ Old `currentPluginName` approach removed
- ✅ Scope system properly maintains parent-child relationships
- ✅ Plugin nesting infrastructure exists and is tested
- ✅ CLI components (Plugin, Command) now use scope system
- ✅ Working example created (`examples/nested-plugins-demo.tsx`)
- ✅ Comprehensive tests added
- ✅ Documentation created

### 2. Scope System - **✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Documentation Claims:**
- Unified ScopeDef type with extensive properties
- CLI components wrap themselves in Scope components
- Automatic command registration from JSX structure

**Completion Status:**
- ✅ Core scope system exists (`src/core/scope.ts`) with ScopeContext type
- ✅ JSX integration exists (`src/core/jsx-scope-integration.ts`)
- ✅ CLI components now use scope wrapping (`Plugin.tsx`, `Command.tsx`)
- ✅ Two scope implementations documented and kept separate by design
- ✅ Automatic command registration from JSX structure works
- ✅ Scope hooks created (`src/core/scope-hooks.ts`)

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture - **Not Implemented**

**Documentation Claims (Phases 2-7):**
- Event bus for cross-module communication
- Domain-specific event emitters and listeners
- Event choreography and orchestration
- Module communication through Effect streams only

**Actual State:**
- No event bus implementation
- Modules communicate through direct imports
- No event-driven patterns in use
- No choreography or orchestration systems

### 4. Advanced Features - **Not Implemented**

The following features described in phases 2-7 do not exist:
- Plugin Development Kit (PDK)
- Performance monitoring system
- Event-driven testing framework
- Component coordination patterns
- Workflow orchestration
- Real-time performance dashboard
- Advanced error recovery
- Plugin security sandboxing

## Inconsistencies Identified

### 1. Documentation vs Reality Gap
The phase documents describe a complete architectural transformation that hasn't been implemented. They should be clearly marked as a **design proposal** rather than current documentation.

### 2. Misleading Problem Statements
Phase 1 describes fixing a "current broken pattern" that has already been fixed. The JSXPluginRegistry already uses a scope stack, not the single string approach described.

### 3. Missing Context
The documents don't clarify that they're proposing a new architecture. A reader would assume these features exist.

### 4. Scope System Confusion
There are two scope implementations:
- Core scope system (comprehensive, Effect-based)
- JSX scope component (simpler, for help rendering)
Neither matches the design in the phase documents.

## Current Architecture Reality

### What Actually Exists:
1. **Solid MVU foundation** with Effect.ts integration
2. **Working JSX runtime** with unified scope stack
3. **Core scope system** with parent-child relationships
4. **Plugin system** that supports basic nesting
5. **Service layer** with Effect-based interfaces
6. **Process management** with native Bun integration

### What's Missing:
1. **Event-driven communication** between modules
2. **Full scope integration** with CLI components
3. **Advanced plugin features** (PDK, sandboxing, etc.)
4. **Performance monitoring** and optimization
5. **Workflow orchestration** capabilities

## Recommendations (Updated Post-Phase 1)

### 1. ✅ Documentation Updated
All phase documents now have clear headers indicating proposal status:
```markdown
# ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN PROPOSAL
## Status: Not Implemented / Completed
```
Phase 1 is marked as completed, phases 2-7 remain proposals.

### 2. ✅ Current State Documentation Created
- `docs/SCOPE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Explains actual implementation
- `docs/SCOPE_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Developer guide
- `CURRENT_SCOPE_SYSTEM_STATUS.md` - Updated with completion status

### 3. Design Documents Remain in Place
The phase documents serve as valuable architectural proposals that may be implemented if future needs arise. They are clearly marked as proposals.

### 4. ✅ Phase 1 Completed Successfully
- Scope system fully integrated with CLI components
- Plugin nesting works as designed
- Comprehensive tests and examples created

### 5. Event-Driven Architecture Assessment
Based on Phase 1 success with direct imports:
- **Recommendation**: Do not implement phases 2-7 unless specific requirements emerge
- The current architecture is simpler and sufficient
- Event-driven complexity not justified by current needs

## Conclusion (Updated Post-Phase 1)

The phase documentation represents an ambitious architectural vision that would transform TUIX from its current direct-module architecture to a fully event-driven system. Phase 1 has been successfully completed, demonstrating that the core plugin nesting issues can be solved without the complexity of a full event-driven transformation.

Current state:
1. ✅ **What exists**: Full scope system with CLI integration
2. ✅ **What's been fixed**: Plugin nesting works correctly
3. ❌ **What remains proposed**: Event-driven architecture (phases 2-7)

The successful Phase 1 implementation suggests that TUIX's current architecture is sufficient for its needs. The event-driven proposals remain available for future consideration if requirements change.
