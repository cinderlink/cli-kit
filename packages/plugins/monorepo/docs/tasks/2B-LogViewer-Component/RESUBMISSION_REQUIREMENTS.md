# Task 2B LogViewer Component - Resubmission Requirements

## Required for Acceptance

### 1. Test File Creation (MANDATORY)
- **File Location**: `src/components/__tests__/LogViewer.test.ts` or similar
- **Test Framework**: Use project's existing test framework (Bun test)
- **Coverage Requirements**: 
  - Minimum 80% line coverage
  - Test all public methods
  - Test error conditions
  - Test streaming functionality

### 2. Test Scenarios Required
- **Component Initialization**: Verify component creates without errors
- **Log Streaming**: Test log entry display and updates
- **Filtering**: Verify log filtering functionality works
- **Performance**: Test with large log volumes
- **Error Handling**: Test with malformed or corrupted log data
- **Memory Management**: Verify proper cleanup and memory usage

### 3. Implementation Verification
- **Working Code**: All implemented features must function correctly
- **Integration**: Component must integrate properly with existing logging system
- **Performance**: Must handle streaming logs without blocking UI
- **Memory Efficiency**: Proper buffer management for large log volumes

### 4. Documentation Requirements
- **API Documentation**: Complete JSDoc for all public methods
- **Usage Examples**: Working code examples showing component usage
- **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with existing log sources
- **Performance Notes**: Memory usage and performance characteristics

### 5. Quality Checklist
- [ ] Test file exists and contains comprehensive tests
- [ ] All tests pass (`bun test`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`bun run tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Component is properly exported and documented
- [ ] Performance meets project standards
- [ ] Memory usage is within acceptable limits

### 6. Submission Process
1. **Create Test File**: Write comprehensive test coverage first
2. **Verify Tests Pass**: Ensure all tests pass before submission
3. **Update Documentation**: Complete all required documentation
4. **Submit for Review**: Include test results and coverage report
5. **No False Claims**: Only submit when ALL requirements are met

### 7. Acceptance Criteria
- PM review will verify test file exists and runs successfully
- All tests must pass without modification
- Code must demonstrate working functionality through tests
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

## Zero Tolerance Policy

Moving forward:
- **No Partial Submissions**: Work must be 100% complete per requirements
- **Accurate Reporting**: Status reports must reflect actual completion state
- **Test-First Approach**: Tests are not optional extras but core requirements
- **Quality Standards**: These are minimum requirements, not suggestions

## Timeline
- **Resubmission Deadline**: To be determined based on priority
- **Review Turnaround**: 24-48 hours after proper submission
- **Final Deadline**: Must include buffer for potential revision cycles

**Remember**: Tests are not documentation - they are executable proof that your code works correctly under various conditions.
