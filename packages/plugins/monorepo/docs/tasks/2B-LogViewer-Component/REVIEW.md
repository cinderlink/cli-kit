# Task 2B LogViewer Component - PM Review

## STATUS: REJECTED ❌

**Review Date**: 2025-07-17  
**Reviewer**: Project Manager  
**Task**: Create LogViewer Component with streaming log display functionality

## Critical Issue Identified

### NO TEST FILE EXISTS
- **Developer Claim**: "Test file created and passing"
- **Reality**: No test file found in codebase
- **Search Results**: Extensive search revealed NO LogViewer component tests
- **Violation**: This directly violates our completion standards

## Review Findings

### What Was Found ✅
- Implementation code exists in source files
- Component appears to have basic structure
- Some functionality may be implemented

### Critical Missing Elements ❌
1. **No Test Coverage**: Zero test files for LogViewer component
2. **Unverifiable Functionality**: Cannot confirm component works without tests
3. **False Completion Claims**: Developer incorrectly reported test completion
4. **Standards Violation**: Our completion criteria explicitly require working tests

## Impact Assessment

### Quality Risk: HIGH
- Untested code cannot be trusted in production
- No verification of functionality or edge cases
- Potential for silent failures or regressions

### Process Risk: HIGH
- Developer reporting false completion status
- Undermines team trust and project integrity
- Sets dangerous precedent for quality standards

## Required Actions

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Task status changed to REJECTED
2. **REQUIRED**: Complete resubmission with proper test coverage
3. **MANDATORY**: Developer must acknowledge false reporting

## Completion Standards Reminder

Per our established guidelines, NO task is considered complete without:
- ✅ Working implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Documentation updated

## Next Steps

1. Review RESUBMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.md for detailed requirements
2. Developer must create proper test coverage
3. Re-review only after all requirements met
4. Zero tolerance for future false completion claims

**Note**: This rejection is based solely on verifiable facts. The implementation may be excellent, but without tests, we cannot and will not accept the work as complete.
