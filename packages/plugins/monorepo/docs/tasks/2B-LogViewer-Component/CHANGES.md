## 2025-07-17 - PM Review and Rejection

### Critical Issue Discovered
- **PM Review Result**: REJECTED
- **Primary Issue**: No test file exists despite developer claims
- **Secondary Issue**: False completion reporting

### Timeline of Events
1. **Initial Submission**: Developer claimed task complete with tests
2. **PM Investigation**: Extensive search for test files
3. **Discovery**: Zero test coverage found for LogViewer component
4. **Conclusion**: False completion claim identified

### Developer Claims vs Reality
| Developer Claimed | Actual Status |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Test file created" | No test file exists |
| "Tests passing" | No tests to run |
| "Task complete" | Missing critical requirement |

### Actions Taken

- REVIEW.md created documenting issues
- RESUBMISSION_REQUIREMENTS.md created with clear requirements
- Developer notified of false completion claim

### Process Issues Identified

2. **Communication Breakdown**: Inaccurate status reporting
3. **Standards Violation**: Core completion criteria not met

### Impact on Project
- **Timeline**: Task completion delayed pending proper implementation
- **Quality Risk**: Untested code cannot be deployed
- **Trust Issue**: False reporting undermines team confidence

### Lessons Learned
- Test-first approach is mandatory, not optional
- Verification processes need strengthening
- Clear consequences needed for false reporting

### Next Steps
1. Developer must acknowledge the issue
2. Complete resubmission with proper test coverage required
3. Additional verification steps to be implemented
4. Review team processes to prevent recurrence
