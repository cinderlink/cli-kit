# Task Review Status

## Task 2B: LogViewer Component - CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE

**Status:** CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE  
**Reviewer:** Claude  
**Review Date:** 2025-01-17  

### Overview
The LogViewer component implementation exists and demonstrates good architectural understanding of the TUIX MVU pattern. However, the test suite requires significant fixes before the task can be considered complete.

### Implementation Assessment

#### ✅ Strengths
- **Architecture**: Proper TUIX MVU implementation with init/update/view pattern
- **Features**: Comprehensive feature set including virtual scrolling, search, filtering, syntax highlighting
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured TypeScript with proper typing
- **Documentation**: Good JSDoc comments and code organization

#### ❌ Critical Issues Requiring Fix
- **Test Suite**: Completely broken - does not run due to multiple structural issues
- **TypeScript Errors**: Compilation errors prevent proper testing
- **Missing Testing Infrastructure**: Tests import non-existent `@tuix/testing` module
- **Test Implementation**: Uses imperative patterns instead of MVU testing approach

### Status Change
Changing status from **REJECTED** to **CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE** because:
1. The core implementation exists and is architecturally sound
2. The main issues are in testing infrastructure, not core functionality
3. Issues are fixable with specific, actionable requirements

### Required Actions
See `REQUIRED_FIXES.md` for detailed fix requirements.

### Next Steps
1. Fix test suite to use proper TUIX MVU testing patterns
2. Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
3. Remove false documentation claims about performance/coverage
4. Resubmit when tests pass and code compiles
