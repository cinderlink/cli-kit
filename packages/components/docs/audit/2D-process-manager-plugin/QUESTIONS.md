   - What process metadata should we track?

3. **State Management**
   - Where should process state be stored (memory, disk, both)?
   - How should we handle state recovery after crashes?
   - Should state be shared across CLI instances?

## Implementation Questions

1. **IPC Design**
   - What IPC mechanism should we use (Unix sockets, TCP, shared memory)?
   - Should we support multiple IPC protocols?
   - How should we handle message ordering and delivery guarantees?

2. **Health Checks**
