# Task 2D: Process Manager Plugin

## Overview
Create a Process Manager Plugin that provides comprehensive process lifecycle management capabilities for CLI applications, including starting, stopping, monitoring, and orchestrating multiple processes.

## Objectives
1. Manage process lifecycle (start, stop, restart, reload)
2. Monitor process health and status
3. Handle process dependencies and orchestration
4. Provide IPC (Inter-Process Communication) capabilities
5. Support process pooling and scaling

## Key Requirements
- **Process Control**: Start, stop, restart processes with various strategies
- **Health Monitoring**: Liveness checks, readiness probes, auto-restart
- **Dependency Management**: Start processes in order, handle dependencies
- **IPC Support**: Enable communication between managed processes
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory limits per process
- **Logging Integration**: Capture and route process stdout/stderr
- **State Persistence**: Save/restore process state across restarts

## Technical Considerations
- Use Bun's subprocess API for process management
- Implement graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts
- Support both foreground and background processes
- Handle process groups and job control
- Cross-platform signal handling

## Success Criteria
- Manage 100+ processes simultaneously
- Process startup time < 50ms
- Zero message loss in IPC
- Graceful handling of all process states
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Plugin integrates seamlessly with CLI framework
