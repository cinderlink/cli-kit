# Task 2E: Logger Plugin

## Overview
Create a comprehensive Logger Plugin that provides structured logging capabilities with multiple transports, formatting options, and integration with the CLI framework.

## Objectives
1. Provide structured logging with multiple log levels
2. Support various output transports (console, file, remote)
3. Enable custom formatting and serialization
4. Integrate with CLI commands and components
5. Support log aggregation and filtering

## Key Requirements
- **Log Levels**: Support standard levels (error, warn, info, debug, trace)
- **Structured Data**: Log with structured metadata and context
- **Multiple Transports**: Console, file, HTTP, syslog, custom
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead, async where appropriate
- **Formatting**: JSON, pretty-print, custom formats
- **Filtering**: Level-based, category-based, custom filters
- **Rotation**: File rotation based on size/time
- **Context**: Automatic context propagation

## Technical Considerations
- Zero-cost abstractions when logging is disabled
- Async transport handling to prevent blocking
- Efficient serialization for structured data
- Support for child loggers with inherited config
- Integration with Error tracking

## Success Criteria
- Logging overhead < 1% in production
- Support 100k+ log entries per second
- Zero message loss under load
- Seamless CLI integration
- Comprehensive filtering capabilities
- Easy configuration and customization
