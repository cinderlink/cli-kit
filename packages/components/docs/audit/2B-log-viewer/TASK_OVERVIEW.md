# Task 2B: LogViewer Component

## Overview
Create a LogViewer component for viewing and searching logs with syntax highlighting and streaming capabilities.

## Objectives
1. Display log entries with proper formatting and syntax highlighting
2. Support real-time log streaming and updates
3. Implement search and filtering functionality
4. Provide level-based log filtering (error, warn, info, debug)
5. Support multiple log formats (JSON, plaintext, structured)

## Key Requirements
- **Performance**: Handle large log files (10MB+) without performance degradation
- **Streaming**: Support real-time log updates via streaming
- **Search**: Fast text search with regex support
- **Highlighting**: Syntax highlighting for different log levels and formats
- **Filtering**: Filter by timestamp, level, source, and custom fields
- **Scrolling**: Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- **Export**: Ability to export filtered logs

## Technical Considerations
- Use virtual scrolling for performance with large datasets
- Implement efficient search algorithms for real-time filtering
- Support ANSI color codes in log output
- Handle various timestamp formats
- Provide keyboard shortcuts for navigation

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Implementation Success Criteria (COMPLETED)
- Component can handle large log datasets with virtual scrolling ✅
- Search and filter operations implemented with regex support ✅ 
- Real-time streaming integration with Stream.Stream support ✅
- Proper syntax highlighting for JSON, SQL, error stacks ✅
- Full TUIX MVU architecture (init/update/view) ✅

### ❌ Testing Success Criteria (REQUIRES FIX)
- Comprehensive test coverage for all features ❌ BROKEN
- Tests must use proper TUIX MVU patterns ❌ USES IMPERATIVE API
- All tests must pass without compilation errors ❌ TYPESCRIPT ERRORS
- Performance claims must be backed by actual tests ❌ SKIPPED TESTS

## Current Status: CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE

**Implementation:** Production-ready and architecturally sound  
**Testing:** Requires complete test suite rewrite to fix broken testing infrastructure
