# Questions for Task 2C: ProcessMonitor Component

## Design Questions

1. **Update Strategy**
   - What should be the default refresh rate (1s, 2s, 5s)?
   - Should refresh rate be adaptive based on system load?
   - How should we handle processes that appear/disappear between updates?

2. **Resource Metrics**
   - Which metrics are most important to display by default?
   - Should we show instantaneous or averaged values?
   - How many historical data points should we keep for trends?

3. **Process Actions**
   - Which process management actions should be supported?
   - How should we handle permission errors gracefully?
   - Should we confirm destructive actions (kill, terminate)?

## Implementation Questions

1. **Platform Support**
   - How should we abstract platform differences?
   - What fallbacks for unsupported platforms?
   - Should we use Bun's native APIs or shell commands?

2. **Performance**
   - What's the acceptable overhead for monitoring?
   - Should we use sampling for high process counts?
   - How often should we collect detailed metrics?

3. **UI Layout**
   - Should we use a table or card-based layout?
   - How should we display process hierarchies?
   - What information density is appropriate?

## Technical Questions

1. **Data Collection**
   - Should we use `/proc` on Linux directly?
   - How to handle privileged process information?
   - What's the best way to calculate CPU percentage?

2. **State Management**
   - How should we store historical metrics?
   - Should process data be globally accessible?
   - How to handle metric aggregation?

3. **Integration**
   - Should this integrate with Process Manager plugin?
   - How should it work with LogViewer for process logs?
   - Should it expose APIs for other components?

## Feature Scope

1. **Advanced Features**
   - Should we support process dependency graphs?
   - Do we need resource usage predictions?
   - Should we include network connections per process?

2. **Visualization**
   - What chart types for resource trends?
   - Should we use ASCII graphs or Unicode?
   - How detailed should sparklines be?
