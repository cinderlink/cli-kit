# Task 2C: ProcessMonitor Component

## Overview
Create a ProcessMonitor component that provides a real-time process monitoring dashboard with comprehensive metrics and system resource visualization.

## Objectives
1. Display running processes with CPU, memory, and resource usage
2. Provide real-time updates of process metrics
3. Show system-wide resource utilization
4. Enable process management actions (start, stop, restart)
5. Visualize resource trends over time

## Key Requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh metrics every 1-5 seconds
- **Process Details**: Show PID, name, CPU%, memory, threads, handles
- **System Metrics**: Overall CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- **Sorting/Filtering**: Sort by any metric, filter by name or resource usage
- **Process Actions**: Kill, restart, change priority
- **Resource Graphs**: Sparklines or mini-charts for trends
- **Alerts**: Threshold-based alerts for high resource usage

## Technical Considerations
- Use efficient system calls for process information
- Implement smart refresh to minimize overhead
- Handle process lifecycle changes gracefully
- Support different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows via Bun)
- Optimize for minimal CPU usage while monitoring

## Success Criteria
- Monitor 500+ processes without performance impact
- Update latency < 100ms for metric changes
- CPU usage of monitor itself < 1%
- Accurate resource measurements
- Stable operation over extended periods
- Cross-platform compatibility
