# Task 3A Integration Testing - Questions

## Status: BLOCKED - Phase 2 Dependency

### Primary Question
**When will Phase 2 TypeScript fixes be completed?**

Integration testing is completely blocked until Phase 2 fixes are done. We need:
1. Clean TypeScript compilation
2. Working test utilities
3. Fixed Effect type usage

## Technical Questions (Once Unblocked)

### 1. Test Infrastructure Design
- Should we use the existing test harness or build new integration-specific utilities?
- What's the preferred approach for service mocking in integration tests?
- How should we handle Effect runtime in tests?

### 2. Coverage Requirements
- What's the target coverage percentage for integration tests?
- Should we focus on happy path or include edge cases?
- How comprehensive should error scenario testing be?

### 3. Performance Expectations
- What's the acceptable runtime for the full integration test suite?
- Should tests run in parallel or sequentially?
- Any specific performance requirements for individual tests?

### 4. Test Environment
- Should integration tests run against real services or mocks?
- How should we handle terminal/rendering in headless environments?
- What's the CI/CD integration strategy?

## Current Blockers (Phase 2 Issues)

### 1. TypeScript Compilation
**Question**: Which specific files need fixing first?
**Current Status**: Multiple test utilities have type errors

### 2. Test Utilities
**Question**: Should we rebuild test utilities from scratch or fix existing ones?
**Current Status**: Existing utilities reference deleted files

### 3. Effect Integration
**Question**: Are there breaking changes in Effect usage patterns?
**Current Status**: Type mismatches throughout test infrastructure

## Design Questions (For Future Planning)

### 1. Test Organization
- Should integration tests be in a separate directory?
- How should we organize tests by feature vs. by layer?
- What naming conventions should we follow?

### 2. Test Data
- How should we handle test data and fixtures?
- Should we use factories or static data?
- How do we ensure test isolation?

### 3. Test Utilities
- What helper functions do we need for integration testing?
- Should we create domain-specific test languages?
- How do we make tests readable and maintainable?

## Process Questions

### 1. Review Process
- Who should review integration test implementations?
- What's the approval process for new test patterns?
- How do we ensure test quality standards?

### 2. Maintenance
- How often should integration tests be updated?
- What's the process for handling flaky tests?
- How do we balance test coverage vs. maintenance burden?

### 3. Documentation
- What level of documentation do integration tests need?
- Should we document test patterns and best practices?
- How do we keep test documentation up to date?

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Phase 2 Coordination
1. **Priority**: Get timeline for Phase 2 completion
2. **Communicate**: Integration testing dependencies
3. **Plan**: Review strategy once Phase 2 is done

### Documentation Updates
1. Update this document as Phase 2 progresses
2. Refine questions based on Phase 2 outcomes
3. Prepare detailed implementation plan

## Answered Questions (To be updated)

*This section will be populated as questions are resolved and Phase 2 fixes are completed.*

## Notes

- This task cannot proceed until Phase 2 is complete
- Questions about implementation details are premature
- Focus should be on Phase 2 completion first
- Integration testing strategy may need revision based on Phase 2 outcomes
