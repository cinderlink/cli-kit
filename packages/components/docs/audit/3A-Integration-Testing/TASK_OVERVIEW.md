# Task 3A: Integration Testing

## Status: BLOCKED - Awaiting Phase 2 TypeScript Fixes

### Task Description
Implement comprehensive integration testing for the Tuix CLI framework, focusing on component interactions, service integration, and CLI command workflows.

### Current Blockers

#### TypeScript Compilation Errors
The project currently has TypeScript errors in test utilities that prevent integration testing:
- Test utilities reference deleted test files
- Type mismatches in Effect usage
- Missing type exports and definitions

**This task cannot proceed until Phase 2 TypeScript fixes are complete.**

### Original Task Goals

1. **Component Integration Testing**
   - Test component interactions and data flow
   - Verify component lifecycle in real scenarios
   - Test focus management across components
   - Validate event propagation

2. **Service Integration Testing**
   - Test service layer interactions
   - Verify renderer, input, and terminal integration
   - Test storage persistence across sessions
   - Validate mouse and keyboard routing

3. **CLI Integration Testing**
   - Test complete CLI command flows
   - Verify plugin system integration
   - Test JSX CLI components
   - Validate help system and routing

4. **Effect Integration Testing**
   - Test Effect runtime behavior
   - Verify error handling across layers
   - Test resource management
   - Validate concurrent operations

### Dependencies

#### Phase 2 Tasks (Must Complete First)
1. Fix TypeScript errors in test utilities
2. Remove references to deleted test files
3. Update Effect type usage throughout test infrastructure
4. Ensure clean TypeScript compilation

#### Required Infrastructure
- Working test utilities (currently broken)
- Clean TypeScript compilation
- Stable component APIs
- Functioning service layer

### Implementation Plan (Once Unblocked)

#### Phase 1: Fix Test Infrastructure
- [ ] Complete Phase 2 TypeScript fixes
- [ ] Verify test utilities compile
- [ ] Update test harness for current APIs
- [ ] Create integration test setup

#### Phase 2: Component Integration Tests
- [ ] Box and layout integration
- [ ] Table data flow testing
- [ ] Input component interactions
- [ ] Modal and focus management
- [ ] List and selection handling

#### Phase 3: Service Integration Tests
- [ ] Renderer service integration
- [ ] Input handling chains
- [ ] Terminal service coordination
- [ ] Storage persistence tests
- [ ] Focus service integration

#### Phase 4: CLI Integration Tests
- [ ] Command execution flows
- [ ] Plugin system integration
- [ ] JSX component rendering
- [ ] Help system functionality
- [ ] Router integration

#### Phase 5: Effect Integration Tests
- [ ] Runtime behavior validation
- [ ] Error propagation testing
- [ ] Resource lifecycle tests
- [ ] Concurrent operation tests

### Success Criteria

1. **TypeScript Compilation**
   - All test files compile without errors
   - No type assertions or workarounds needed

2. **Test Coverage**
   - 80% line coverage for integration paths
   - All major user workflows tested
   - Error scenarios properly tested

3. **Test Performance**
   - Integration tests run in < 30 seconds
   - Individual tests complete in < 1 second
   - No flaky or timing-dependent tests

4. **Documentation**
   - Integration test patterns documented
   - Examples for common test scenarios
   - Troubleshooting guide for test failures

### Risk Mitigation

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Focus on Phase 2 fixes first
   - Don't attempt workarounds
   - Fix root causes in test utilities

2. **Test Complexity**
   - Start with simple integration scenarios
   - Build up to complex workflows
   - Use component test utilities where possible

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Avoid full runtime tests where possible
   - Use focused integration tests
   - Parallelize test execution

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Complete Phase 2 TypeScript fixes
2. **Then**: Review and update this task plan
3. **Finally**: Begin integration test implementation

### Notes

- This task is completely blocked until TypeScript compilation is clean
- Do not attempt to work around TypeScript errors
- Focus efforts on Phase 2 fixes before returning to this task
- Integration testing is critical for framework stability
