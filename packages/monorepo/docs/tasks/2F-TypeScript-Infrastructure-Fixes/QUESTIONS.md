# TypeScript Infrastructure Fixes - Developer Questions

## Pre-Implementation Questions

### Project Scope and Priorities
1. **Should we prioritize fixing specific error categories first?**
   - View namespace issues seem to block many other fixes
   - Error class overrides appear to be isolated and could be done in parallel
   - Which category is most critical for immediate functionality?

2. **Are there any components or features that are not currently in use?**
   - Should we fix errors in unused components or focus on active ones?
   - Are there any deprecated components we can skip?

3. **What is the acceptable approach for breaking changes?**
   - Can we make internal API changes if they don't affect public interfaces?
   - Should we maintain backward compatibility for all current usage patterns?

### Technical Approach Questions

#### View Namespace Issues
4. **What is the intended structure for the View namespace?**
   - Should View be a namespace, interface, or class?
   - Are there existing architectural decisions that constrain how we fix this?

5. **How should we handle circular dependencies in the view system?**
   - Is it acceptable to restructure the module organization?
   - Should we create a separate types module to break cycles?

#### Error Class Hierarchy
6. **What is the preferred error handling pattern for this project?**
   - Should all custom errors extend the base Error class?
   - Are there specific error interfaces that need to be maintained?

7. **How should error class inheritance work with TypeScript 5.x?**
   - Should we use abstract base classes or interfaces?
   - What level of error typing granularity is desired?

#### Color System Type Safety
8. **What should be the behavior when color parsing fails?**
   - Should invalid colors throw errors, return defaults, or return null?
   - Are there existing error handling patterns we should follow?

9. **How strict should color type validation be?**
   - Should we accept any string and validate at runtime?
   - Should we use branded types for validated colors?

#### Component Interface Compliance
10. **Are there standard component interfaces that all components should implement?**
    - What are the required properties/methods for a valid component?
    - Should we enforce these through abstract base classes or interfaces?

11. **How should component props and state be typed?**
    - Should we use generic constraints for props?
    - What is the preferred pattern for component state management?

#### JSX Runtime Integration
12. **What JSX element types should be supported?**
    - Should all components return JSX.Element or is Component<Props> preferred?
    - How should we handle components that return strings or numbers?

13. **How should the JSX runtime integrate with the component system?**
    - Should JSX components be a separate layer or integrated with base components?
    - What are the performance implications of different approaches?

## Implementation Questions

### Development Process
14. **Should we create feature branches for each subtask or work on main?**
    - How should we structure commits for easy rollback?
    - What is the preferred git workflow for this type of fix?

15. **How should we handle tests that are currently failing due to type errors?**
    - Should we fix tests first or implementation first?
    - Are there tests that need to be updated to match new type constraints?

### Quality Assurance
16. **What constitutes acceptable test coverage after fixes?**
    - Should we add new tests for type safety scenarios?
    - Are there specific edge cases we should test for?

17. **How should we validate that fixes don't break runtime behavior?**
    - Which examples are most critical to verify?
    - Should we run performance benchmarks before/after?

### Validation and Testing
18. **Are there specific testing environments or configurations to verify?**
    - Should we test with different TypeScript compiler versions?
    - Are there specific tsconfig.json settings that must be supported?

19. **How should we handle type errors that appear in development vs production builds?**
    - Are there different strictness levels for different environments?
    - Should all fixes work with `strict: true` in TypeScript?

## Post-Implementation Questions

### Documentation and Communication
20. **What documentation needs to be updated after fixes?**
    - Should we document new type patterns or constraints?
    - Are there developer guides that reference the changed APIs?

21. **Should we create guidelines to prevent similar type errors in the future?**
    - What linting rules or practices should be established?
    - Should we add pre-commit hooks for type checking?

### Monitoring and Maintenance
22. **How should we monitor for type regressions going forward?**
    - Should type checking be part of CI/CD?
    - What tools should be used for ongoing type safety monitoring?

23. **What is the process for handling future type-related changes?**
    - Should type changes require special review or approval?
    - How should breaking type changes be communicated to developers?

## Escalation Questions

### Technical Blockers
24. **If fundamental architectural changes are needed, who should approve them?**
    - What level of change requires additional review or discussion?
    - Are there specific stakeholders who need to sign off on major changes?

25. **If fixes require breaking changes to public APIs, how should we proceed?**
    - Should we maintain compatibility layers?
    - What is the process for communicating breaking changes?

### Resource and Timeline Questions
26. **If fixes take longer than estimated, what should be prioritized?**
    - Which fixes are absolutely critical vs nice-to-have?
    - Should we consider partial fixes or workarounds for complex issues?

27. **If additional resources or expertise are needed, how should that be requested?**
    - Are there TypeScript experts who could review complex fixes?
    - Should we consider external consultation for difficult architectural decisions?
